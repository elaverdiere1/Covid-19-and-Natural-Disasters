Gordon's ill-defined center made landfall near the Suwannee River around midnight of the 18th.  Official, maximum sustained winds of 53 mph, with gusts as high as 68 mph, were observed at the C-MAN automated weather sensor at Cedar Key in Levy county prior to landfall near the mouth of the Suwannee River during the late evening of the 17th.Hurricane Gordon produced maximum storm tides above mean sea level of 2 to 4 feet from Lee north to Manatee county, 4 to 5.5 feet along the Pinellas and Hillsborough county coastlines, and 2 to 4 feet from Pasco north to Levy county on the 17th.Coastal flooding from storm surge was minimal from Lee county north to the Tampa metropolitan area. Near downtown Tampa, a foot of water covered the south and northern lanes of Bayshore Boulevard during midday on the 17th.  Coastal flood waters between one and two feet covered coastal roads along Longboat Key in Manatee county and Siesta and Casey Keys in Sarasota county.  In Pinellas county, nearly a foot of water covered coastal roads from St. Pete Beach to Clearwater.  The Courtney Campbell Parkway, seperating Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, was closed, due to storm surge flooding, from nearly 5 to 9 pm on the 17th.Beach erosion was minor from Lee north to Charlotte, moderate to severe along Sarasota and Manatee counties, minor to moderate over Manatee, Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando counties.  At Bradenton Beach in Manatee county, nearly 100 feet of pristine beach, five to six feet in depth, was stripped away by wave action from Hurricane Gordon.  In Sarasota county, storm surge and wave action from Gordon caused nearly 1.1 million dollars in beach erosion while in Manatee county, beach erosion was estimated at 500 thousand dollars.Inland flooding from rainfall occurred over low-lying and urban areas in mainly Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, DeSoto, Highlands and southern Polk counties (see flood entries).Eastern rain bands of Hurricane Gordon spawned at least five known tornadoes, two F1's and three F0's over Central and Southwest Florida (see tornado entries).Damage in Levy county was confined to roofs and toppled trees, mainly in the Cedar Key area, where a total of $100,000 dollars was estimated.Damage in Citrus county was confined to a few downed trees, power lines and snapped branches from Sulphur Springs south to Ozello mounting to less than $25,000 dollars.Damage in Hernando county was confined to ten homes that suffered floodwater damage along the coast along with a few toppled trees and downed power lines.  Damage in Hernando county was estimated at $100,000 dollars.Damage in Pasco county was confined to 15 roof damaged villas, downed trees and damaged vehicles in the New Port Colony Villas subdivsion in New Port Richey estimated at $250,000 dollars.In Pinellas county, 51 single-family homes, 32 mobile homes, 27 multi-family homes and 24 businesses sustained minor wind or water damage.  Estimated cost of the damage in Pinellas county was nearly $500,000 dollars.In Hillsborough county, 40 homes in low lying coastal areas from Ruskin to Gibsonton to Riverview, incurred flooding from storm surge.  Also, several homes were damaged from wind toppled trees and large branches throughout Hillsborough county.  Estimated cost of the damage in Hillsborough county was near $500,000 dollars.In Manatee county, 25 homes and businesses were flooded in Bradenton Beach and several homes incurred minor to moderate roof damage in Anna Maria.  At Coquina Beach in Manatee county, 60 mph wind gusts, associated with an outer feeder band of Gordon, toppled life guard towers and destroyed an anemometer. Property damage from Hurricane Gordon was estimated at nearly $500,000 dollars in Manatee county.In Sarasota county, eight foot high waves, caused nearly $600,000 in property damage to the Venice Municipal Fishing Pier.  The hurricane induced waves ripped a 20 foot section and three 50 foot concrete pilings from the northern section of the pier.In Lee county, tropical storm force winds caused roof, awning and lanai damage to nine homes, toppled several large trees and branches, and downed power lines across Cape Coral and Ft. Myers.  Also, tornadoes, associated with outer feeder bands of Hurricane Gordon, caused significant damage on Sanibel Island of extreme western Lee county (see Lee county tornado entries).Max Wind Gust:		68 mph - Cedar Key, Levy Co.		2153 EST		09/17Lowest Pressure:		994.2 mb - Cedar Key, Levy Co.		2200 EST		09/17Max Rainfall:		6.39 in - Page Field, Ft.

Maximum sustained winds reached 50 knots, with gusts to 62 knots at Buoy 42039, 80 miles south of Panama City, FL.  The lowest sea-level pressure was 999.6 mb at Panama City.  Rainfall totals ranged from 9.26 inches at Mossy Head, FL, to 0.15 inches at Cross City, FL.  Storm tides along the Gulf coast varied from ten feet in Bay and Walton counties to four feet in Taylor and Dixie counties.  Large swells from Ivan began to the affect the Gulf coast from the St. Joseph Peninsula to the Suwannee River on September 14.  Storm surges continued for several hours after landfall.  Beach erosion varied from extreme (20 to 40 feet) in Walton County to minor at St. George Island.  Minor areal flooding affected much of the Florida Panhandle, including Walton, Bay, Holmes, Calhoun, Jackson and Gulf counties.  Sharp rises to near or slightly above minor flood levels occurred on the Choctawhatchee River at Caryville, the Apalachicola River at Blountstown, and the Shoal River at Mossy Head.  An estimated 165,000 customers were without power.  There were widespread reports of downed trees and power lines.  The hardest hit areas were Gulf, Bay, and Walton counties, where more than 50 percent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Numerous roads in the Panhandle coastal counties were flooded or washed out.  Intense outer rain bands from Ivan spawned numerous tornadoes over portions of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.  The hardest hit counties were Bay, Calhoun, and Jackson counties, which accounted for six deaths and 16 injuries.  Mandatory evacuations of low lying, coastal, and mobile home residents was ordered by officials in Bay, Walton, Jackson, Holmes, Jackson, Franklin, and Taylor counties.  A state of emergency and presidential request for federal assistance were declared for the affected counties.",No entry,12017,28.85,-82.52

The peak wind gust and lowest sea-level pressure recorded were 67 knots and 979 mb, respectively, at Buoy 42039 located 80 miles south of Panama City, FL.  Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 4 inches in the eastern Florida Panhandle to 6 to 10 inches in the Florida Big Bend.  Flooding was reported in southern Leon County where several areas were under 3 to 4 feet of water.  Maximum coastal storm surge heights ranged from 4 to 8 feet in Walton, Bay, Gulf, Taylor and Dixie counties to 8 to 12 feet in Franklin, Wakulla and Jefferson counties.  Moderate to severe beach erosion was observed along the beaches of Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla counties.  Across coastal Walton County, all public dunes and walkovers were damaged.  At St George Island, five miles of road and numerous structures were damaged or destroyed by Dennis' storm surge.  Dennis' deluge caused several rivers and creeks in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend to exceed their flood stages, including the Ocklockonee, Aucilla, St Marks rivers, and Spring Creek.  An interesting aspect to the flooding is the remarkable surge up to 8 feet that propagated up the rivers.  This surge was evident from the mouth of the Suwannee River to as far west as the Choctawhatchee River.  The worst property damage occurred along the coast from Walton to Wakulla County, where more than a 1,000 homes and businesses were affected.  Also, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines across the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend, leaving about 75,000 customers without power.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,12017,28.85,-82.52

She moved across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then turned north into the Atlantic and became a hurricane on September 20.  Jeanne made a clockwise loop for three days in the Atlantic north of Hispaniola before moving west northwest. It strengthened to a Category 3 Hurricane while over the northwest Bahamas and then make landfall around 11 P.M., September 25 near the south end of Hutchinson Island, nearly coincident with the landfall point of Hurricane Frances nearly three week before.  The 40-mile diameter eye was not quite as large as Frances, but the southern eyewall again affected northeast Palm Beach County.  After landfall Jeanne initially moved along a track similar to Frances, just north of Lake Okeechobee as it weakened to a tropical storm then it turned to the northwest and moved over the northwest Florida Peninsula.Although slightly smaller and stronger then Hurricane Frances, winds and pressures  over southeast Florida were remarkably similar to Frances.  Unfortunately, the ASOS at West Palm Beach International Airport quit sending data during the height of the hurricane. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred over most of Palm Beach and northeast Glades counties and portions of Broward, Hendry and Collier counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, portions of northern Palm Beach County mostly likely experienced them.  A South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) instrument in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee measured a 15-minute sustained wind of 79 mph with a peak gust of 105 mph.  In metropolitan Palm Beach the highest official sustained wind speed was 60 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph from the C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier. An unofficial peak wind gust of 125 mph was measured in West Palm Beach at the Solid Waste Treatment Plant.   In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest sustained wind measured at a SFWMD instrument was 68 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph. Near Clewiston the highest measured sustained wind was 31 mph with a peak wind gust of 72 mph from a SFWMD instrument.  The highest measured sustained wind in Broward County was 46 mph with a peak wind gust of 67 mph from the ASOS site at Pompano Beach Airpark.  At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport the ASOS site measured a maximum sustained wind of 40 mph with a peak gust of 56 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 49 mph with a peak gust of 59 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 26 mph and gusts to 36 mph at Miami International Airport ASOS.  At the Naples Municipal Airport, the ASOS maximum sustained wind was measured at 33 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph.  The lowest barometric pressure of 960.4 mb was measured at a SFWMD site in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee.A SFWMD gage measured a maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 10.22 inches over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  A SFWMD gage about four miles west of West Palm Beach International Airport measured 9.10 inches with 8.79 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period. At Moore Haven, 5.99 inches of rain was measured.  Widespread storm-total amounts of one to four inches occurred in most of southeast and interior south Florida with Miami-Dade County and Collier County averaging one half to one inch. Mostly minor rainfall flooding was observed except locally severe in Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter and in the farmlands of western Palm Beach County.The estimated maximum storm surge ranged from two to four feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to one to two feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to seven feet above and below normal causing severe flooding of some marinas.  Beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and minor in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.There were no confirmed tornadoes.There were no known direct deaths but four persons died in the aftermath.  An unknown number of injuries occurred. Property damage from storm surge and winds at the coast occurred to condos, marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats and a few coastal roadways. Inland wind damage to building roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, and outbuildings occurred over mainly over Palm Beach County and portions of eastern Glades and Hendry counties.A preliminary damage estimate for Jeanne in southeast Florida is $330 million, including $260 million in Palm Beach, $50 million in Broward and $10 million in Miami-Dade.  Agricultural  Damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at $30 million.Florida Power and Light reported outages occurred to 591,300 customers in Palm Beach, 165,900 in Broward, 25,100 in Miami-Dade, 5,200 in Collier, 3,000 in Hendry and 1,500 in Glades.

Frances became a Category 4 Hurricane on August 28 while about 700 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Frances then moved generally west northwest and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane while crossing the northwest Bahamas.  After stalling for about 12 hours on September 4 in the Florida Straits between Grand Bahama Island and the southeast Florida coast, the center of the nearly 70-mile diameter eye crossed the Florida coast near Sewalls Point, at 1 A.M. EDT, September 5, 2004 with the southern eyewall affecting the extreme northeast portion of Palm Beach County.  Frances moved farther inland just north of Lake Okeechobee and weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the entire Florida Peninsula and exiting into the Gulf of Mexico just north of Tampa late on September 5.  It made a second landfall as a tropical storm in the eastern Florida Panhandle.Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred in all six south Florida counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, an NWS instrument on the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee at Port Mayaca, just across the Palm Beach County border, measured a sustained wind of 85 mph.  At West Palm Beach International Airport the highest sustained wind was 64 mph with a peak gust of 82 mph and the lowest observed barometric pressure was 972 mb.  A South Florida Water Management District instrument measured a peak wind gust of 92 mph over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  The estimated peak wind gust in the Palm Beach metro area was 91 mph at Jupiter Inlet with a peak wind gust of 87 mph measured by a C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier.  In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest measured sustained wind was 60 mph with a peak gust of 90 mph.  In Clewiston, a sustained wind of 60 mph with a gust of 80 mph was estimated.  The highest measured sustained wind at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was 41 mph with a peak gust of 55 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 62 mph with a peak gust of 78 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 42 mph and a peak gust of 59 mph at Miami International Airport.  At the Naples Municipal Airport the ASOS measured a maximum sustained wind of 38 mph with a peak gust of 54 mph.A maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 13.56 inches was measured at West Palm Beach International Airport with 10.36 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period.  Unofficial storm-total rainfalls included 9.56 inches at Boynton Beach, 8 inches at Deerfield Beach and 7.18 inches at Hillsboro Canal.  Widespread storm-total amounts of 3 to 5 inches occurred in southeast and interior south Florida with southwest Florida averaging 1 to 3 inches.  Rainfall flooding was mostly minor except for a few locations in Palm Beach County which had up to 3 feet of standing water.  A section of I-95 in Palm Beach County was closed due to a large sinkhole.The maximum storm surge was estimated to have ranged from 2 to 4 feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to 1 to 2 feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to 5 feet above and below normal. Coastal beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and portions of Broward counties and was minor in Miami-Dade and Collier counties.There were no confirmed tornadoes.There were no known direct deaths, but at least 9 people died in the aftermath.  Six of these deaths occurred in Palm Beach County, mainly as the result of vehicle-related accidents or from drownings.  Two vehicle-related deaths were reported in Broward County and one person died in Collier County while clearing debris.  An unknown number of injuries occurred.Property damage at the coast occurred mainly to marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats.  Inland structure damage included 15,000 houses and 2,400 businesses in Palm Beach County.  Wind damage to house roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, screened enclosures and outbuildings occurred over much of southeast Florida including areas near Lake Okeechobee, but was greatest in Palm Beach County.A preliminary damage estimate for Frances in south Florida is $620 million, including $500 million in Palm Beach, $80 million in Broward, and $34 million in Miami-Dade.  Crop damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at an additional $70 million to sugar cane and vegetables and additional heavy losses occurred to nurseries.Florida Power and Light reported power outages occurred to 659,000 customer in Palm Beach, 590,000 in Broward, 423,000 in Miami-Dade, 39,200 in Collier, 2,500 in Hendry and 1,700 in Collier.

Major Hurricane Dennis impacted portions of the area during the day and evening of July 10th.    The storm made landfall around 130 PM CST as a category three hurricane near Navarre Beach in Santa Rosa county.  Dennis then moved north northwest across Santa Rosa and northeast Escambia county in Florida.  The weakening storm then moved across the west part of Escambia, the south part of Monroe, the east part of Clarke and the northeast part of Choctaw counties in Alabama.  Dennis had a very small eye and winds around the eyewall of the storm caused significant damage as the storm moved north.  An aerial survey of the damage showed a five to ten mile wide area of destruction, with most of the damage east of the eye of the storm.  As Dennis moved north into Alabama the damage diminished and was confined to a smaller area.  A lot of the damage looked like a giant tornado, except the trees were all facing in the same general direction. Coastal counties across the area from Mobile to Destin were put under a Hurricane Watch at 300 PM CST on July 8, then a Hurricane Warning at 300 AM CST on July 9.  An Inland Hurricane Warning was issued for most of the inland counties in Alabama at 436 PM CST on July 9.  Parts of southeast Mississippi were added to the warning during the early morning hours of July 10.  Most of the warnings were dropped at 900 PM CST on July 10 as Dennis weakened as it moved inland.Some of the wind reports from across northwest Florida on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 66 knots with peak gust of 81 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 39 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 46 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 48 knots, peak gust of 72 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  49 knots, peak gust 64 knots.  Crestview, sustained wind of 37 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Navarre, peak gust of 105 knots.  Pensacola (near airport), peak gust 83 knots.  Destin (near airport), peak gust 70 knots. Pace, peak gust 92 knots.  Pensacola (southeast of airport), peak gust 88 knots.  Some of the wind reports across southwest Alabama on July 10 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 32 knots, peak gust of 42 knots.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind at 42 knots, gust to 57 knots.    Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), peak gust 67 knots.  Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Dennis on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport, 956.6 MB.  Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), 986.1 MB.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, 976.6 MB.  Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), 987.8 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport, 990.5 MB.    The highest 48 hour rainfall totals associated with Hurricane Dennis: In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR) 7.67 inches.  Pace, 6.90 inches.  Milton, 7.01 inches.  Munson, 6.93 inches.  Niceville, 5.15 inches.  In Alabama: Bay Minette, 4.65 inches.   Butler 4.36 inches.The highest storm tides from Dennis occurred at: Pensacola with 5.50 feet.  Santa Rosa Sound with 5.00 feet.  Destin with 4.60 feet.  Perdido Pass with 4.10 feet.  Pace with 3.5 feet.  A storm survey measured 6-6.5 feet on Navarre Beach.  Since the eye of Dennis was very small, the highest surge values were near and just to the right of the eye of the storm.  Some higher surge values occurred well east of Destin before Dennis moved ashore.Major beach erosion occurred from Pensacola Beach to east of Destin.  Minor beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to Orange Beach.  Major flash flooding occurred along and east of the center of Dennis during the afternoon and evening of July 10 across northwest Florida and southwest Alabama.    As Dennis moved inland,  tornado like damage occurred near the eyewall of storm.  Almost every structure located on Navarre Beach suffered some kind of damage.  The structures that were located on the beach front all suffered damage.   The Air Force bases at Eglin and Hurlburt reported over a half billion dollars in damage from Dennis.  Almost 200 homes in northwest Florida reported major damage.  Part of U. S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin in Okaloosa county were again washed out by high water.  The west bound lanes were damaged by the surge but the east bound lanes were okay.  It was also estimated that most of this years cotton crop in northwest Florida was damaged.No direct deaths were reported with Dennis, but three indirect deaths were reported.  Two died from Carbon Monoxide poisoning in Escambia county Florida and one from electrocution in Escambia county Alabama.  All of the deaths were related to the improper use of emergency generators.",No entry,12005,30.24,-85.63

Storm tides were estimated at 1 foot above normal...which in concert with higher-than-usual astronomical tides produced water levels up to 2 feet above normal.  These values were similar to what was achieved during Hurricane Charley.  Wind damage was limited to downed tree limbs in the Keys between the Seven Mile Bridge and Key West.

Wave action produced extensive flooding of the park grounds outside of the Fort Jefferson walls.  Approximately 1000 feet of brickwork was lost on the outer moat wall, which was completely submerged at the time of high tide.  Numerous finger docks and the deck of the main dock were destroyed.  Scaffolding used during the Fort's multi-year renovation project was also damaged and found floating in the moat.  The Dry Tortugas C-MAN station, which included instrumentation less than 15 feet above mean sea level, was also destroyed, likely from the combination of wave action and elevated tide levels.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,12015,26.9,-81.95

Gordon's ill-defined center made landfall near the Suwannee River around midnight of the 18th.  Official, maximum sustained winds of 53 mph, with gusts as high as 68 mph, were observed at the C-MAN automated weather sensor at Cedar Key in Levy county prior to landfall near the mouth of the Suwannee River during the late evening of the 17th.Hurricane Gordon produced maximum storm tides above mean sea level of 2 to 4 feet from Lee north to Manatee county, 4 to 5.5 feet along the Pinellas and Hillsborough county coastlines, and 2 to 4 feet from Pasco north to Levy county on the 17th.Coastal flooding from storm surge was minimal from Lee county north to the Tampa metropolitan area. Near downtown Tampa, a foot of water covered the south and northern lanes of Bayshore Boulevard during midday on the 17th.  Coastal flood waters between one and two feet covered coastal roads along Longboat Key in Manatee county and Siesta and Casey Keys in Sarasota county.  In Pinellas county, nearly a foot of water covered coastal roads from St. Pete Beach to Clearwater.  The Courtney Campbell Parkway, seperating Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, was closed, due to storm surge flooding, from nearly 5 to 9 pm on the 17th.Beach erosion was minor from Lee north to Charlotte, moderate to severe along Sarasota and Manatee counties, minor to moderate over Manatee, Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando counties.  At Bradenton Beach in Manatee county, nearly 100 feet of pristine beach, five to six feet in depth, was stripped away by wave action from Hurricane Gordon.  In Sarasota county, storm surge and wave action from Gordon caused nearly 1.1 million dollars in beach erosion while in Manatee county, beach erosion was estimated at 500 thousand dollars.Inland flooding from rainfall occurred over low-lying and urban areas in mainly Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, DeSoto, Highlands and southern Polk counties (see flood entries).Eastern rain bands of Hurricane Gordon spawned at least five known tornadoes, two F1's and three F0's over Central and Southwest Florida (see tornado entries).Damage in Levy county was confined to roofs and toppled trees, mainly in the Cedar Key area, where a total of $100,000 dollars was estimated.Damage in Citrus county was confined to a few downed trees, power lines and snapped branches from Sulphur Springs south to Ozello mounting to less than $25,000 dollars.Damage in Hernando county was confined to ten homes that suffered floodwater damage along the coast along with a few toppled trees and downed power lines.  Damage in Hernando county was estimated at $100,000 dollars.Damage in Pasco county was confined to 15 roof damaged villas, downed trees and damaged vehicles in the New Port Colony Villas subdivsion in New Port Richey estimated at $250,000 dollars.In Pinellas county, 51 single-family homes, 32 mobile homes, 27 multi-family homes and 24 businesses sustained minor wind or water damage.  Estimated cost of the damage in Pinellas county was nearly $500,000 dollars.In Hillsborough county, 40 homes in low lying coastal areas from Ruskin to Gibsonton to Riverview, incurred flooding from storm surge.  Also, several homes were damaged from wind toppled trees and large branches throughout Hillsborough county.  Estimated cost of the damage in Hillsborough county was near $500,000 dollars.In Manatee county, 25 homes and businesses were flooded in Bradenton Beach and several homes incurred minor to moderate roof damage in Anna Maria.  At Coquina Beach in Manatee county, 60 mph wind gusts, associated with an outer feeder band of Gordon, toppled life guard towers and destroyed an anemometer. Property damage from Hurricane Gordon was estimated at nearly $500,000 dollars in Manatee county.In Sarasota county, eight foot high waves, caused nearly $600,000 in property damage to the Venice Municipal Fishing Pier.  The hurricane induced waves ripped a 20 foot section and three 50 foot concrete pilings from the northern section of the pier.In Lee county, tropical storm force winds caused roof, awning and lanai damage to nine homes, toppled several large trees and branches, and downed power lines across Cape Coral and Ft.

The fast movement of Hurricane Charley limited rain fall totals to 4 to 6 inches along the track of the hurricane's eye wall. River flooding of one to three feet above flood stage was found on area rivers south of Interstate 4.  Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers. Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward. The center of Charley crossed the barrier islands of Cayo Costa and Gasparilla Island at 345 PM EDT, then moved up Charlotte Harbor before making landfall at Mangrove Point, just southwest of Punta Gorda, at 435 PM EDT.  By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport.Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.  An estimated 250 people were treated by three different remote medical teams dispatched throughout the county. In Lee County, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated eight foot storm surge that cut a new pass 300 yards wide across North Captiva Island.  The storm surge was estimated at 4 to 6 feet at Fort Myers Beach, Horseshoe Key, and Port Boca Grand.  Two direct and two indirect deaths were blamed on this hurricane. Sustained winds of 61 mph with gusts to 78 mph were recorded at the Fort Myers Regional Southwest airport. A personal weather station in Fort Myers recorded a wind gust of 95 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed 41% of the homes in Cape Coral, ripped the roof off of the post office in Fort Myers, and lead to 1.9 millions cubic yards of debris in Lee County. There was one direct death attributed to the storm when a tree fell on a person outside smoking. There were three indirect fatalities due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator, a candle burned down a mobile home, and one heart attack. In DeSoto County the storm shelter at the Civic Center in Arcadia lost one wall and the roof pealed back while 1,200 evacuees were inside.  A wind gust of 104 mph was recorded in Arcadia where the storm  downed a water tower.  The majority of Arcadia's downtown was heavily damaged or destroyed and a mobile home park along State Road 72 was flattened. There was one direct fatality in a tool shed that was destroyed by the wind. In Sarasota there was one direct fatality a wind gust blew a car off the road and it hit a tree. Downed trees  knocked out power and damaged homes in the eastern part of the county. In Manatee County an unofficial report of 100 mph was reported in the southeast tip of the county.

Major Hurricane Dennis impacted portions of the area during the day and evening of July 10th.    The storm made landfall around 130 PM CST as a category three hurricane near Navarre Beach in Santa Rosa county.  Dennis then moved north northwest across Santa Rosa and northeast Escambia county in Florida.  The weakening storm then moved across the west part of Escambia, the south part of Monroe, the east part of Clarke and the northeast part of Choctaw counties in Alabama.  Dennis had a very small eye and winds around the eyewall of the storm caused significant damage as the storm moved north.  An aerial survey of the damage showed a five to ten mile wide area of destruction, with most of the damage east of the eye of the storm.  As Dennis moved north into Alabama the damage diminished and was confined to a smaller area.  A lot of the damage looked like a giant tornado, except the trees were all facing in the same general direction. Coastal counties across the area from Mobile to Destin were put under a Hurricane Watch at 300 PM CST on July 8, then a Hurricane Warning at 300 AM CST on July 9.  An Inland Hurricane Warning was issued for most of the inland counties in Alabama at 436 PM CST on July 9.  Parts of southeast Mississippi were added to the warning during the early morning hours of July 10.  Most of the warnings were dropped at 900 PM CST on July 10 as Dennis weakened as it moved inland.Some of the wind reports from across northwest Florida on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 66 knots with peak gust of 81 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 39 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 46 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 48 knots, peak gust of 72 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  49 knots, peak gust 64 knots.  Crestview, sustained wind of 37 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Navarre, peak gust of 105 knots.  Pensacola (near airport), peak gust 83 knots.  Destin (near airport), peak gust 70 knots. Pace, peak gust 92 knots.  Pensacola (southeast of airport), peak gust 88 knots.  Some of the wind reports across southwest Alabama on July 10 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 32 knots, peak gust of 42 knots.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind at 42 knots, gust to 57 knots.    Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), peak gust 67 knots.  Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Dennis on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport, 956.6 MB.  Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), 986.1 MB.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, 976.6 MB.  Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), 987.8 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport, 990.5 MB.    The highest 48 hour rainfall totals associated with Hurricane Dennis: In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR) 7.67 inches.  Pace, 6.90 inches.  Milton, 7.01 inches.  Munson, 6.93 inches.  Niceville, 5.15 inches.  In Alabama: Bay Minette, 4.65 inches.   Butler 4.36 inches.The highest storm tides from Dennis occurred at: Pensacola with 5.50 feet.  Santa Rosa Sound with 5.00 feet.  Destin with 4.60 feet.  Perdido Pass with 4.10 feet.  Pace with 3.5 feet.  A storm survey measured 6-6.5 feet on Navarre Beach.  Since the eye of Dennis was very small, the highest surge values were near and just to the right of the eye of the storm.  Some higher surge values occurred well east of Destin before Dennis moved ashore.Major beach erosion occurred from Pensacola Beach to east of Destin.  Minor beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to Orange Beach.  Major flash flooding occurred along and east of the center of Dennis during the afternoon and evening of July 10 across northwest Florida and southwest Alabama.    As Dennis moved inland,  tornado like damage occurred near the eyewall of storm.  Almost every structure located on Navarre Beach suffered some kind of damage.  The structures that were located on the beach front all suffered damage.   The Air Force bases at Eglin and Hurlburt reported over a half billion dollars in damage from Dennis.  Almost 200 homes in northwest Florida reported major damage.  Part of U. S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin in Okaloosa county were again washed out by high water.  The west bound lanes were damaged by the surge but the east bound lanes were okay.  It was also estimated that most of this years cotton crop in northwest Florida was damaged.No direct deaths were reported with Dennis, but three indirect deaths were reported.  Two died from Carbon Monoxide poisoning in Escambia county Florida and one from electrocution in Escambia county Alabama.  All of the deaths were related to the improper use of emergency generators.",No entry,12001,29.683333333333,-82.366666666667

The Wakulla River at Wakulla Springs also had its 2nd highest crest on record behind Hurricane Dennis (2005) at 7.49 ft NGVD29.  There were three tornadoes confirmed, all brief EF0's in Taylor county with no damage reported from them.  Rainfall generally ranged from 3-8 with minimal impacts from inland flooding.  Inland wind impacts were significant.  County by county impacts are as follows.  ||In Taylor county, 6 people were rescued from high water related to surge in Steinhatchee.  There were also 5 other rescues in the county.  Approximately 75 homes or businesses sutained major damage, 60 had minor damage, and 140 were affected.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,12115,27.19,-82.37

Gordon's ill-defined center made landfall near the Suwannee River around midnight of the 18th.  Official, maximum sustained winds of 53 mph, with gusts as high as 68 mph, were observed at the C-MAN automated weather sensor at Cedar Key in Levy county prior to landfall near the mouth of the Suwannee River during the late evening of the 17th.Hurricane Gordon produced maximum storm tides above mean sea level of 2 to 4 feet from Lee north to Manatee county, 4 to 5.5 feet along the Pinellas and Hillsborough county coastlines, and 2 to 4 feet from Pasco north to Levy county on the 17th.Coastal flooding from storm surge was minimal from Lee county north to the Tampa metropolitan area. Near downtown Tampa, a foot of water covered the south and northern lanes of Bayshore Boulevard during midday on the 17th.  Coastal flood waters between one and two feet covered coastal roads along Longboat Key in Manatee county and Siesta and Casey Keys in Sarasota county.  In Pinellas county, nearly a foot of water covered coastal roads from St. Pete Beach to Clearwater.  The Courtney Campbell Parkway, seperating Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, was closed, due to storm surge flooding, from nearly 5 to 9 pm on the 17th.Beach erosion was minor from Lee north to Charlotte, moderate to severe along Sarasota and Manatee counties, minor to moderate over Manatee, Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando counties.  At Bradenton Beach in Manatee county, nearly 100 feet of pristine beach, five to six feet in depth, was stripped away by wave action from Hurricane Gordon.  In Sarasota county, storm surge and wave action from Gordon caused nearly 1.1 million dollars in beach erosion while in Manatee county, beach erosion was estimated at 500 thousand dollars.Inland flooding from rainfall occurred over low-lying and urban areas in mainly Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, DeSoto, Highlands and southern Polk counties (see flood entries).Eastern rain bands of Hurricane Gordon spawned at least five known tornadoes, two F1's and three F0's over Central and Southwest Florida (see tornado entries).Damage in Levy county was confined to roofs and toppled trees, mainly in the Cedar Key area, where a total of $100,000 dollars was estimated.Damage in Citrus county was confined to a few downed trees, power lines and snapped branches from Sulphur Springs south to Ozello mounting to less than $25,000 dollars.Damage in Hernando county was confined to ten homes that suffered floodwater damage along the coast along with a few toppled trees and downed power lines.  Damage in Hernando county was estimated at $100,000 dollars.Damage in Pasco county was confined to 15 roof damaged villas, downed trees and damaged vehicles in the New Port Colony Villas subdivsion in New Port Richey estimated at $250,000 dollars.In Pinellas county, 51 single-family homes, 32 mobile homes, 27 multi-family homes and 24 businesses sustained minor wind or water damage.  Estimated cost of the damage in Pinellas county was nearly $500,000 dollars.In Hillsborough county, 40 homes in low lying coastal areas from Ruskin to Gibsonton to Riverview, incurred flooding from storm surge.  Also, several homes were damaged from wind toppled trees and large branches throughout Hillsborough county.  Estimated cost of the damage in Hillsborough county was near $500,000 dollars.In Manatee county, 25 homes and businesses were flooded in Bradenton Beach and several homes incurred minor to moderate roof damage in Anna Maria.  At Coquina Beach in Manatee county, 60 mph wind gusts, associated with an outer feeder band of Gordon, toppled life guard towers and destroyed an anemometer. Property damage from Hurricane Gordon was estimated at nearly $500,000 dollars in Manatee county.In Sarasota county, eight foot high waves, caused nearly $600,000 in property damage to the Venice Municipal Fishing Pier.  The hurricane induced waves ripped a 20 foot section and three 50 foot concrete pilings from the northern section of the pier.In Lee county, tropical storm force winds caused roof, awning and lanai damage to nine homes, toppled several large trees and branches, and downed power lines across Cape Coral and Ft. Myers.

Prior to making landfall in southwest Florida, Irma had previously reached Category 5 strength and made landfalls in Cuba and the Florida Keys. At it's peak, Irma had a central pressure of 914 mb. ||The maximum storm surge in southwest Florida was 3.88 feet in Fort Myers at midnight EST on the 11th. Subtracting the astronomical tide of 0.04 feet, the maximum storm tide was calculated from the tide gauge as 3.28 feet MHHW at 2:36 PM EST on the 11th. Farther north, the storm surge was generally less than 3 feet. Due to the track making landfall south of the area then moving north and parallel but inland of the coast, strong offshore flow north of the eye produced in even stronger negative storm surge before the positive surge in most areas as water was pushed away from the coast. ||Rain from Irma started to accumulate over southwest Florida and interior parts of west central Florida on the morning and afternoon of the 10th, with most of the area seeing the highest rain totals during the early morning hours of the 11th. The rain then largely ended by mid morning on the 11th. Most of the area saw rainfall accumulations of 5-10 inches, with some isolated spots seeing totals of over 15 inches. The highest rain total reported was 18.65 inches at the home weather station D1496 in Beverly Hills in Citrus County. The widespread heavy rain caused significant river flooding issues across west central and southwest Florida, with major flooding being observed at points on the Withlacoochee, Anclote, Hillsborough, Alafia, Little Manatee, and Peace Rivers as well as the Horse Creek. ||The collective effects of Hurricane Irma in west central and southwest Florida during the period of September 10 and 11 resulted in 2 direct fatalities, 14 indirect fatalities, an estimated $2.2 billion in property damage (adding individual assistance claims and public assistance claims, not including the cost of debris removal and emergency protective measures when known), and $379 million in crop damage. A total of 509 homes and businesses were destroyed, 5,589 had major damage, 18,834 sustained minor damage, and 61,920 were affected by Hurricane Irma in west central and southwest Florida.||County-by-County Impacts||Lee County - In inland portions of Lee county, the highest wind reported from Hurricane Irma was a gust to 77 knots at the ASOS at Southwest Florida International Airport during the late afternoon on the 10th. Rainfall was generally around 5 inches or greater, with the highest rain total being 11.59 inches at a mesonet site at the waste plant on Buckingham Road in Fort Myers. The wind resulted in damage to numerous homes, as well as knocking over trees and power lines, while heavy rain also causing flood damage to many homes. Lee County Emergency Management reported that 92 homes or businesses were destroyed by Irma, 2088 sustained major damage, 1721 had minor damage, and an additional 20426 were affected throughout Lee County. The total property damage from Irma in Lee County was estimated at $826.28 million in individual damage assessments, of which, $163.14 million was estimated to be caused by wind damage in inland portions of Lee County. Additionally, crop damage to citrus plants in Lee County was roughly estimated at $9.6 million.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,12027,27.19,-81.81

Rainfall totals ranged from 9.26 inches at Mossy Head, FL, to 0.15 inches at Cross City, FL.  Storm tides along the Gulf coast varied from ten feet in Bay and Walton counties to four feet in Taylor and Dixie counties.  Large swells from Ivan began to the affect the Gulf coast from the St. Joseph Peninsula to the Suwannee River on September 14.  Storm surges continued for several hours after landfall.  Beach erosion varied from extreme (20 to 40 feet) in Walton County to minor at St. George Island.  Minor areal flooding affected much of the Florida Panhandle, including Walton, Bay, Holmes, Calhoun, Jackson and Gulf counties.  Sharp rises to near or slightly above minor flood levels occurred on the Choctawhatchee River at Caryville, the Apalachicola River at Blountstown, and the Shoal River at Mossy Head.  An estimated 165,000 customers were without power.  There were widespread reports of downed trees and power lines.  The hardest hit areas were Gulf, Bay, and Walton counties, where more than 50 percent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Numerous roads in the Panhandle coastal counties were flooded or washed out.  Intense outer rain bands from Ivan spawned numerous tornadoes over portions of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.  The hardest hit counties were Bay, Calhoun, and Jackson counties, which accounted for six deaths and 16 injuries.  Mandatory evacuations of low lying, coastal, and mobile home residents was ordered by officials in Bay, Walton, Jackson, Holmes, Jackson, Franklin, and Taylor counties.

Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 4 inches in the eastern Florida Panhandle to 6 to 10 inches in the Florida Big Bend.  Flooding was reported in southern Leon County where several areas were under 3 to 4 feet of water.  Maximum coastal storm surge heights ranged from 4 to 8 feet in Walton, Bay, Gulf, Taylor and Dixie counties to 8 to 12 feet in Franklin, Wakulla and Jefferson counties.  Moderate to severe beach erosion was observed along the beaches of Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla counties.  Across coastal Walton County, all public dunes and walkovers were damaged.  At St George Island, five miles of road and numerous structures were damaged or destroyed by Dennis' storm surge.  Dennis' deluge caused several rivers and creeks in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend to exceed their flood stages, including the Ocklockonee, Aucilla, St Marks rivers, and Spring Creek.  An interesting aspect to the flooding is the remarkable surge up to 8 feet that propagated up the rivers.  This surge was evident from the mouth of the Suwannee River to as far west as the Choctawhatchee River.  The worst property damage occurred along the coast from Walton to Wakulla County, where more than a 1,000 homes and businesses were affected.

Maximum sustained winds reached 50 knots, with gusts to 62 knots at Buoy 42039, 80 miles south of Panama City, FL.  The lowest sea-level pressure was 999.6 mb at Panama City.  Rainfall totals ranged from 9.26 inches at Mossy Head, FL, to 0.15 inches at Cross City, FL.  Storm tides along the Gulf coast varied from ten feet in Bay and Walton counties to four feet in Taylor and Dixie counties.  Large swells from Ivan began to the affect the Gulf coast from the St. Joseph Peninsula to the Suwannee River on September 14.  Storm surges continued for several hours after landfall.  Beach erosion varied from extreme (20 to 40 feet) in Walton County to minor at St. George Island.  Minor areal flooding affected much of the Florida Panhandle, including Walton, Bay, Holmes, Calhoun, Jackson and Gulf counties.  Sharp rises to near or slightly above minor flood levels occurred on the Choctawhatchee River at Caryville, the Apalachicola River at Blountstown, and the Shoal River at Mossy Head.  An estimated 165,000 customers were without power.  There were widespread reports of downed trees and power lines.  The hardest hit areas were Gulf, Bay, and Walton counties, where more than 50 percent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Numerous roads in the Panhandle coastal counties were flooded or washed out.  Intense outer rain bands from Ivan spawned numerous tornadoes over portions of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.  The hardest hit counties were Bay, Calhoun, and Jackson counties, which accounted for six deaths and 16 injuries.  Mandatory evacuations of low lying, coastal, and mobile home residents was ordered by officials in Bay, Walton, Jackson, Holmes, Jackson, Franklin, and Taylor counties.

The peak wind gust and lowest sea-level pressure recorded were 67 knots and 979 mb, respectively, at Buoy 42039 located 80 miles south of Panama City, FL.  Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 4 inches in the eastern Florida Panhandle to 6 to 10 inches in the Florida Big Bend.  Flooding was reported in southern Leon County where several areas were under 3 to 4 feet of water.  Maximum coastal storm surge heights ranged from 4 to 8 feet in Walton, Bay, Gulf, Taylor and Dixie counties to 8 to 12 feet in Franklin, Wakulla and Jefferson counties.  Moderate to severe beach erosion was observed along the beaches of Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla counties.  Across coastal Walton County, all public dunes and walkovers were damaged.  At St George Island, five miles of road and numerous structures were damaged or destroyed by Dennis' storm surge.  Dennis' deluge caused several rivers and creeks in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend to exceed their flood stages, including the Ocklockonee, Aucilla, St Marks rivers, and Spring Creek.  An interesting aspect to the flooding is the remarkable surge up to 8 feet that propagated up the rivers.  This surge was evident from the mouth of the Suwannee River to as far west as the Choctawhatchee River.  The worst property damage occurred along the coast from Walton to Wakulla County, where more than a 1,000 homes and businesses were affected.

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.  Gusty west winds developed on August 30th as Katrina was dissipating over the Tennessee and Ohio Valley.  However, wind gusts were mostly in the 20-30 mph range, which resulted in just isolated incidents of downed trees and power lines throughout the day across north and west Georgia.",No entry,13049,30.78,-82.14

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",No entry,13049,30.78,-82.14

Official, maximum sustained winds of 53 mph, with gusts as high as 68 mph, were observed at the C-MAN automated weather sensor at Cedar Key in Levy county prior to landfall near the mouth of the Suwannee River during the late evening of the 17th.Hurricane Gordon produced maximum storm tides above mean sea level of 2 to 4 feet from Lee north to Manatee county, 4 to 5.5 feet along the Pinellas and Hillsborough county coastlines, and 2 to 4 feet from Pasco north to Levy county on the 17th.Coastal flooding from storm surge was minimal from Lee county north to the Tampa metropolitan area. Near downtown Tampa, a foot of water covered the south and northern lanes of Bayshore Boulevard during midday on the 17th.  Coastal flood waters between one and two feet covered coastal roads along Longboat Key in Manatee county and Siesta and Casey Keys in Sarasota county.  In Pinellas county, nearly a foot of water covered coastal roads from St. Pete Beach to Clearwater.  The Courtney Campbell Parkway, seperating Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, was closed, due to storm surge flooding, from nearly 5 to 9 pm on the 17th.Beach erosion was minor from Lee north to Charlotte, moderate to severe along Sarasota and Manatee counties, minor to moderate over Manatee, Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando counties.  At Bradenton Beach in Manatee county, nearly 100 feet of pristine beach, five to six feet in depth, was stripped away by wave action from Hurricane Gordon.  In Sarasota county, storm surge and wave action from Gordon caused nearly 1.1 million dollars in beach erosion while in Manatee county, beach erosion was estimated at 500 thousand dollars.Inland flooding from rainfall occurred over low-lying and urban areas in mainly Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, DeSoto, Highlands and southern Polk counties (see flood entries).Eastern rain bands of Hurricane Gordon spawned at least five known tornadoes, two F1's and three F0's over Central and Southwest Florida (see tornado entries).Damage in Levy county was confined to roofs and toppled trees, mainly in the Cedar Key area, where a total of $100,000 dollars was estimated.Damage in Citrus county was confined to a few downed trees, power lines and snapped branches from Sulphur Springs south to Ozello mounting to less than $25,000 dollars.Damage in Hernando county was confined to ten homes that suffered floodwater damage along the coast along with a few toppled trees and downed power lines.  Damage in Hernando county was estimated at $100,000 dollars.Damage in Pasco county was confined to 15 roof damaged villas, downed trees and damaged vehicles in the New Port Colony Villas subdivsion in New Port Richey estimated at $250,000 dollars.In Pinellas county, 51 single-family homes, 32 mobile homes, 27 multi-family homes and 24 businesses sustained minor wind or water damage.  Estimated cost of the damage in Pinellas county was nearly $500,000 dollars.In Hillsborough county, 40 homes in low lying coastal areas from Ruskin to Gibsonton to Riverview, incurred flooding from storm surge.  Also, several homes were damaged from wind toppled trees and large branches throughout Hillsborough county.  Estimated cost of the damage in Hillsborough county was near $500,000 dollars.In Manatee county, 25 homes and businesses were flooded in Bradenton Beach and several homes incurred minor to moderate roof damage in Anna Maria.  At Coquina Beach in Manatee county, 60 mph wind gusts, associated with an outer feeder band of Gordon, toppled life guard towers and destroyed an anemometer. Property damage from Hurricane Gordon was estimated at nearly $500,000 dollars in Manatee county.In Sarasota county, eight foot high waves, caused nearly $600,000 in property damage to the Venice Municipal Fishing Pier.  The hurricane induced waves ripped a 20 foot section and three 50 foot concrete pilings from the northern section of the pier.In Lee county, tropical storm force winds caused roof, awning and lanai damage to nine homes, toppled several large trees and branches, and downed power lines across Cape Coral and Ft.

The fast movement of Hurricane Charley limited rain fall totals to 4 to 6 inches along the track of the hurricane's eye wall. River flooding of one to three feet above flood stage was found on area rivers south of Interstate 4.  Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers. Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward. The center of Charley crossed the barrier islands of Cayo Costa and Gasparilla Island at 345 PM EDT, then moved up Charlotte Harbor before making landfall at Mangrove Point, just southwest of Punta Gorda, at 435 PM EDT.  By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport.Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.  An estimated 250 people were treated by three different remote medical teams dispatched throughout the county. In Lee County, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated eight foot storm surge that cut a new pass 300 yards wide across North Captiva Island.  The storm surge was estimated at 4 to 6 feet at Fort Myers Beach, Horseshoe Key, and Port Boca Grand.  Two direct and two indirect deaths were blamed on this hurricane. Sustained winds of 61 mph with gusts to 78 mph were recorded at the Fort Myers Regional Southwest airport. A personal weather station in Fort Myers recorded a wind gust of 95 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed 41% of the homes in Cape Coral, ripped the roof off of the post office in Fort Myers, and lead to 1.9 millions cubic yards of debris in Lee County. There was one direct death attributed to the storm when a tree fell on a person outside smoking. There were three indirect fatalities due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator, a candle burned down a mobile home, and one heart attack. In DeSoto County the storm shelter at the Civic Center in Arcadia lost one wall and the roof pealed back while 1,200 evacuees were inside.  A wind gust of 104 mph was recorded in Arcadia where the storm  downed a water tower.  The majority of Arcadia's downtown was heavily damaged or destroyed and a mobile home park along State Road 72 was flattened. There was one direct fatality in a tool shed that was destroyed by the wind. In Sarasota there was one direct fatality a wind gust blew a car off the road and it hit a tree. Downed trees  knocked out power and damaged homes in the eastern part of the county. In Manatee County an unofficial report of 100 mph was reported in the southeast tip of the county.  Downed trees and power lines in the eastern part of the county forced officials to close the Myakka City Elementary School through August 20th.

The fast movement of Hurricane Charley limited rain fall totals to 4 to 6 inches along the track of the hurricane's eye wall. River flooding of one to three feet above flood stage was found on area rivers south of Interstate 4.  Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers. Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward. The center of Charley crossed the barrier islands of Cayo Costa and Gasparilla Island at 345 PM EDT, then moved up Charlotte Harbor before making landfall at Mangrove Point, just southwest of Punta Gorda, at 435 PM EDT.  By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport.Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.  An estimated 250 people were treated by three different remote medical teams dispatched throughout the county. In Lee County, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated eight foot storm surge that cut a new pass 300 yards wide across North Captiva Island.  The storm surge was estimated at 4 to 6 feet at Fort Myers Beach, Horseshoe Key, and Port Boca Grand.  Two direct and two indirect deaths were blamed on this hurricane. Sustained winds of 61 mph with gusts to 78 mph were recorded at the Fort Myers Regional Southwest airport. A personal weather station in Fort Myers recorded a wind gust of 95 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed 41% of the homes in Cape Coral, ripped the roof off of the post office in Fort Myers, and lead to 1.9 millions cubic yards of debris in Lee County. There was one direct death attributed to the storm when a tree fell on a person outside smoking. There were three indirect fatalities due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator, a candle burned down a mobile home, and one heart attack. In DeSoto County the storm shelter at the Civic Center in Arcadia lost one wall and the roof pealed back while 1,200 evacuees were inside.  A wind gust of 104 mph was recorded in Arcadia where the storm  downed a water tower.  The majority of Arcadia's downtown was heavily damaged or destroyed and a mobile home park along State Road 72 was flattened. There was one direct fatality in a tool shed that was destroyed by the wind. In Sarasota there was one direct fatality a wind gust blew a car off the road and it hit a tree. Downed trees  knocked out power and damaged homes in the eastern part of the county. In Manatee County an unofficial report of 100 mph was reported in the southeast tip of the county.  Downed trees and power lines in the eastern part of the county forced officials to close the Myakka City Elementary School through August 20th. The damage total listed was estimated by doubling the insured losses.  The doubling accounted for uninsured losses and damage to the public infrastructure.",No entry,12061,27.7,-80.58

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",No entry,22049,32.3,-92.55

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",No entry,22049,32.3,-92.55

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.","Hurricane Gustav affected over 900 homes with 31 homes being destroyed, 66 receiving major damage, and 126 minor damage. Damage estimates were from preliminary American Red Cross surveys. Many businesses also received damage and numerous trees and utility poles were knocked down. Most of the damage was caused by the high winds associated with Gustav.",22049,32.3,-92.55

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities.

Lili tracked north and slightly east through Louisiana during the day on the third, weakening by evening to a tropical depression near Monroe, Louisiana.  The dying system eventually tracked across the Mississippi Delta in the subsequent overnight hours.  Thunderstorm bands, strong winds, and associated tornadoes created damage across northeastern Louisiana during the afternoon and evening hours on the third.  Most of the damage in northeastern Louisiana was in the form of (or caused by) downed trees.  Wind gusts in this area of Louisiana remained below hurricane strength.  However, saturated ground conditions from the combined rainfall of Lili and Isidore (which moved over the same area a week earlier) allowed winds to push down numerous trees.  One such tree in Morehouse Parish fell upon a house, causing considerable damage.  Rainfall amounts from this event were over 3 inches in many areas although no major instances of flooding occurred.  Estimated damage for the storm was $500,000.",22007,29.9,-91.06

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28037,31.48,-90.9

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28027,34.23,-90.6

Over 48,000 claims were filed with FEMA by homeowners who received damage. along the path of Lili, from southwest Louisiana into central Louisiana. Only 3 injuries were reported. One injury in Evangeline Parish at Ville Platte occurred when a policeman on patrol had a tree fall on his vehicle, trapping him inside. He received minor injuries and was treated and released from a local hospital. The other two injuries occurred in Acadia Parish. Two Rayne city employees were moving vehicles to a safer location when a brick facade at the water plant fell on them. Tornadoes and Flash Flood events associated with Lili are listed separately.

Wind gusts over 110 mph were recorded in Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes. This resulted in numerous trees and power lines downed. In parts of Beauregard, Jeff Davis, and Vermilion Parishes, winds blew over 90 mph. The remainder of southwest Louisiana saw wind gusts in excess of 50 mph. Only one direct fatality has been reported. A man drowned near a sunken shrimping vessel near the Calcasieu ship channel. Estimated damages in southwest Louisiana total near 4 billion dollars, with the bulk of that loss in Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes. Entire towns were destroyed in Cameron Parish, including downtown Cameron, Creole, Holly Beach, and Grand Chenier. An estimated 90 to 95 percent of the homes in the parish were severely damaged or destroyed - over 5000 residences. Storm surge values are estimated around 15 feet in parts of Cameron Parish. The storm surge also moved up the Calcasieu ship channel, flooding portions of Calcasieu Parish, including sections of downtown Lake Charles near the civic center, where the storm surge was estimated between 6 and 8 feet. Storm surge also was a significant problem in Vermilion Parish, which saw locations 10 ft above sea level flooded - including all of Pecan Island, Intracoastal City, and Delcambre. The storm surge extended further east, into Iberia and St. Mary Parishes, where an estimated 5 to 10 ft storm surge damaged homes along and south of Highway 90, especially near Cypremort Point, Burns Point, and Franklin.",No entry,22031,32.06,-93.74

Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 51 knots from the north with a peak gust of 65 knots from the north northeast.

The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",No entry,1061,31.092222222222,-85.838333333333

Major Hurricane Katrina impacted portions of the area during the day of August 29th.    The storm made landfall over southeast Louisiana around sunrise on August 29.  The center of Katrina tracked north northeast near I-59 across southeast Mississippi.  Katrina had a large eye and the wind field was also very large.  Gusts to hurricane force were felt as far east as the Alabama and Mississippi state line. Wind damage from Katrina decreased as you got farther east of the center of the storm.  However, high storm surge values were observed as far east as Destin in Okaloosa county.  The storm surge with Katrina was one of the highest ever recorded as far east as Mobile Bay.  Coastal counties in Alabama were put under a Hurricane Watch  at 300 PM CST on August 27, then a Hurricane Warning at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The coastal counties in northwest Florida were put under a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The Hurricane Watch was dropped for the coastal counties in northwest Florida at 900 AM CST on August 29.  The Tropical Storm Warning for northwest Florida was dropped at 300 PM CST on August 29.  The Hurricane Warning for coastal Alabama was changed to a Tropical Storm Warning at 300 PM CST on August 29.  All tropical warnings were dropped for the entire area at 900 PM CST on August 29 as Katrina moved rapidly inland.  An inland Hurricane Warning was issued for southeast Mississippi and parts of southwest Alabama on August 27 and August 28.  All inland tropical warnings were dropped the evening of August 29.Some of the wind reports from across southwest Alabama on August 29 were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 57 knots with a peak gust of 72 knots.  Brookley Field, sustained wind of 58 knots with a peak gust of 73 knots.  Evergreen, sustained wind of 32 knots with a peak gust of 42 knots. Dauphin Island, sustained wind of 64 knots with a peak gust of 89 knots.  USS Alabama, peak gust 90 knots.  Semmes, peak gust of 57 knots.  Fairhope, peak gust 54 knots.  Middle Bay Lighthouse, peak gust of 72 knots. Wind reports across northwest Florida: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 49 knots with a peak gust of 60 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 49 knots with a peak gust 62 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 50 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 33 knots with a peak gust of 46 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  30 knots with a peak gust 44 knots.  Mary Esther, sustained wind of 38 knots with a peak gust of 52 knots.  Wind gusts across southeast Mississippi  were estimated to be between 70 and 80 knots.Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Katrina on August 29 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, 983.4 MB. Brookley, 985.8 MB. Dauphin Island, 986.1 MB. Semmes, 982.7 MB.The highest 48 hour rainfall totals (ending at midnight on August 29). In Alabama: Mobile Regional Airport, 3.80 inches.

Okaloosa county with 4-6 feet.  The surge values in Mobile Bay were among the highest ever recorded for the area.  Over 20 million dollars in damage was done to the Alabama State Docks due to the high surge.Major beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to east of Destin.  The west end of Dauphin Island was completely under water with most of the homes on the west end washed away.  Flash flooding occurred throughout the day as Katrina moved inland.  High winds from Katrina caused significant tree and power line damage to the counties that border the Mississippi and Alabama state line.  Stone and Perry counties in Mississippi received the most damage.  The damage in those two counties resembled the inland damage that hurricane Ivan produced in Alabama last year. Highway 98 in Okaloosa county again had some of the lanes damage due to surge.  I-10 bridge across Pensacola Bay was closed for several hours due to high winds.  The Wallace Tunnel was closed due to high water from the surge.  Most of the businesses on the Causeway over Mobile Bay were damaged or destroyed by the high water.  An oil rig being worked on broke free and floated up Mobile Bay and became lodged underneath the Cochran-Africatown Bridge.  The bridge had to be closed for several hours until it could be inspected for damage.  Several weak tornadoes occurred across the area.No direct deaths were reported with Katrina in southeast Mississippi, southwest Alabama and northwest Florida.",No entry,1061,31.092222222222,-85.838333333333

Over 48,000 claims were filed with FEMA by homeowners who received damage. along the path of Lili, from southwest Louisiana into central Louisiana. Only 3 injuries were reported. One injury in Evangeline Parish at Ville Platte occurred when a policeman on patrol had a tree fall on his vehicle, trapping him inside. He received minor injuries and was treated and released from a local hospital. The other two injuries occurred in Acadia Parish. Two Rayne city employees were moving vehicles to a safer location when a brick facade at the water plant fell on them. Tornadoes and Flash Flood events associated with Lili are listed separately. Property damage estimates were based on insured losses reported to the state government.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28065,31.56,-89.82

The western side of Ivan effected a large portion of Eastern Mississippi as the center moved north through Alabama. Thousands of trees were blown down across Eastern Mississippi during the event as well as hundreds of power lines. The strong wind itself did not cause much structural damage, however the fallen trees did. These downed trees accounted for several hundred homes, mobile homes and businesses to be damaged or destroyed. Most locations across Eastern Mississippi reported sustained winds between 30 and 40 mph with Tropical Storm force gusts between 48 and 54 mph. The strongest reported winds occurred in Newton, Lauderdale and Oktibbeha counties. A Mississippi mesonet site, in Newton, reported maximum sustained winds of 42 mph and peak gust of 54 mph. At Key Field in Meridian, maximum sustained winds were reported at 43 mph with a peak gust of 61 mph. The highest sustained and peak wind occurred at the Mississippi State Climate Lab in Starkville. This site reported maximum sustained winds of 52 mph and a peak gust of 64 mph.Overall, rainfall totals were held in check as Ivan steadily moved north. The heaviest rains were confined to far Eastern Mississippi where 3 to 4 inches fell over a 15 hour period. Due to the duration of the rain no flooding was reported.Across Eastern Mississippi, Hurricane Ivan was responsible for one fatality. This fatality occurred in Brooksville when a tree fell on a man. Damage from Ivan was estimated at $200 Million.",No entry,28057,34.28,-88.36

The storm moved north-northwest across Southwest Alabama and then into East-Central Mississippi and finally across Northeast Mississippi during the overnight hours. Wind gusts over tropical storm force were common across areas east of a line from Starkville to Newton to Hattiesburg. These winds caused several hundred trees to uproot or snap and took down numerous power lines. Additionally, a total of 21 homes or businesses sustained minor to major damage from fallen trees or gusty winds.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments.

The hurricane warning was dropped at 900 AM CST on September 16 and we were put under a tropical storm warning.  The tropical storm warning was dropped at 300 PM CST on September 16.  Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 51 knots from the north with a peak gust of 65 knots from the north northeast.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind of 61 knots from the east with a gust of 89 knots from the northeast. USS Alabama, located off the Mobile Bay causeway,  peak gust 91 knots (site is more than 100 feet high). Fairhope, peak gust 63 knots.  Semmes, peak gust 51 knots.  Grand Bay, peak gust 62 knots.  WKRG in Mobile, peak gust 64 knots.  Wallace Tunnel in Mobile, peak gust 51 knots. Gulf Shores Airport, sustained winds 73 knots with a peak gust of 100 knots (Doppler on Wheels site).  Fairhope, sustained wind 59 knots with a peak gust of 77 knots (Doppler on wheels). Some of the winds across Northwest Florida were as follows:  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 76 knots from the southeast with a gust of 93 knots from the southeast.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained wind of 67 knots from the southeast with a peak gust of 87 knots. West Pensacola, peak gust 84 knots.

Eglin Air Force Base (VPS) 7.43 inches. 10 S Mossy Head 8.92 inches.Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",No entry,1063,32.852222222222,-87.950833333333

Major Hurricane Katrina impacted portions of the area during the day of August 29th.    The storm made landfall over southeast Louisiana around sunrise on August 29.  The center of Katrina tracked north northeast near I-59 across southeast Mississippi.  Katrina had a large eye and the wind field was also very large.  Gusts to hurricane force were felt as far east as the Alabama and Mississippi state line. Wind damage from Katrina decreased as you got farther east of the center of the storm.  However, high storm surge values were observed as far east as Destin in Okaloosa county.  The storm surge with Katrina was one of the highest ever recorded as far east as Mobile Bay.  Coastal counties in Alabama were put under a Hurricane Watch  at 300 PM CST on August 27, then a Hurricane Warning at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The coastal counties in northwest Florida were put under a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The Hurricane Watch was dropped for the coastal counties in northwest Florida at 900 AM CST on August 29.  The Tropical Storm Warning for northwest Florida was dropped at 300 PM CST on August 29.  The Hurricane Warning for coastal Alabama was changed to a Tropical Storm Warning at 300 PM CST on August 29.  All tropical warnings were dropped for the entire area at 900 PM CST on August 29 as Katrina moved rapidly inland.  An inland Hurricane Warning was issued for southeast Mississippi and parts of southwest Alabama on August 27 and August 28.  All inland tropical warnings were dropped the evening of August 29.Some of the wind reports from across southwest Alabama on August 29 were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 57 knots with a peak gust of 72 knots.  Brookley Field, sustained wind of 58 knots with a peak gust of 73 knots.  Evergreen, sustained wind of 32 knots with a peak gust of 42 knots. Dauphin Island, sustained wind of 64 knots with a peak gust of 89 knots.  USS Alabama, peak gust 90 knots.  Semmes, peak gust of 57 knots.  Fairhope, peak gust 54 knots.  Middle Bay Lighthouse, peak gust of 72 knots. Wind reports across northwest Florida: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 49 knots with a peak gust of 60 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 49 knots with a peak gust 62 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 50 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 33 knots with a peak gust of 46 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  30 knots with a peak gust 44 knots.  Mary Esther, sustained wind of 38 knots with a peak gust of 52 knots.  Wind gusts across southeast Mississippi  were estimated to be between 70 and 80 knots.Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Katrina on August 29 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, 983.4 MB. Brookley, 985.8 MB. Dauphin Island, 986.1 MB. Semmes, 982.7 MB.The highest 48 hour rainfall totals (ending at midnight on August 29). In Alabama: Mobile Regional Airport, 3.80 inches.

Okaloosa county with 4-6 feet.  The surge values in Mobile Bay were among the highest ever recorded for the area.  Over 20 million dollars in damage was done to the Alabama State Docks due to the high surge.Major beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to east of Destin.  The west end of Dauphin Island was completely under water with most of the homes on the west end washed away.  Flash flooding occurred throughout the day as Katrina moved inland.  High winds from Katrina caused significant tree and power line damage to the counties that border the Mississippi and Alabama state line.  Stone and Perry counties in Mississippi received the most damage.  The damage in those two counties resembled the inland damage that hurricane Ivan produced in Alabama last year. Highway 98 in Okaloosa county again had some of the lanes damage due to surge.  I-10 bridge across Pensacola Bay was closed for several hours due to high winds.  The Wallace Tunnel was closed due to high water from the surge.  Most of the businesses on the Causeway over Mobile Bay were damaged or destroyed by the high water.  An oil rig being worked on broke free and floated up Mobile Bay and became lodged underneath the Cochran-Africatown Bridge.  The bridge had to be closed for several hours until it could be inspected for damage.  Several weak tornadoes occurred across the area.No direct deaths were reported with Katrina in southeast Mississippi, southwest Alabama and northwest Florida.",No entry,1063,32.852222222222,-87.950833333333

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars.

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28025,33.65,-88.77

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28043,33.77,-89.8

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.

Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",No entry,22067,32.82,-91.8

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.   Approximately 75% of the damage was estimated to be related to wind - $11.8 million.  Approximately 25% of the storm damage was estimated to be related to storm surge - $4.0 million.",No entry,22067,32.82,-91.8

This depression moved northwest over the Yucatan Peninsula and emerged over the south central Gulf of Mexico on July 4.  On July 5th the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and moved north toward the southeast Louisiana coast.  Cindy made landfall in southeast Louisiana early on July 6th just to the west of Grand Isle, and reached minimal hurricane strength for a short period of time. Cindy then turned toward the northeast and moved over the New Orleans area and toward the Mississippi coast before dissipating inland over central Alabama later that day.  Cindy initially was classified as a tropical storm, but was later upgraded to a minimal hurricane based primarily on doppler radar wind estimates of a small area of hurricane force winds just east of the path of the hurricane in the coastal waters and extreme southeast coastal sections.  Most of southeast Louisiana, including the metro New Orleans area experience long duration of tropical storm force winds and high gusts that resulted in considerable wind damage to trees and foliage as well as widespread power outages due to downed electrical lines.  An estimated 278,000 electrical customers experienced power outages. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at the New Orleans Lakefront for five and a half hours starting around 11 pm CDT on July 5th with gusts greater than 55 mph recorded each hour during this period. The maximum sustained wind at the Lakefront Airport was 54 mph, or 47 knots, at 300 AM CDT on July 6th.  A peak gust of 70 mph, or 61 knots,  was recorded at the airport at 116 am CDT on July 6th.  This was the highest wind gust measured during the storm over land areas with the exception of 74 mph, or 64 knots, along the coast at the elevated Burwood CMAN station at 149 am CDT on July 6th.  A gust to 69 mph, or 60 knots, was also recorded at the NOAA C-Man station at Grand Isle. The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 55 mph, or 48 knots, at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle. Heavy rainfall resulted in extensive street flooding with rainfall generally amounts ranging from 3 to a little over 6 inches across much of extreme southeast Louisiana.  The lowest pressure measured in southeast Louisiana were 997.3 mb at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle and also at the LSU Citrus Agricultural Station near Port Sulphur.  High tides caused storm surge flooding and beach erosion at Grand Isle.  The highest storm surge recorded was 5.5 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupree near Lake Borgne.Overall Hurricane Cindy caused approximately $50 million in damage in southeast Louisiana; with $2.5 million from storm surge and the remainder from wind damage. The damage estimate was based on damage estimates from Tropical Storm Bill which took a similar track but was a weaker tropical cyclone.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",No entry,22067,32.82,-91.8

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.",Hurricane Gustav affected over 600 homes in lower Lafourche Parish with around 35 homes being destroyed and 400 receiving major to minor damage. Many businesses also received damage and numerous trees and utility poles were knocked down. Considerable damage occurred from both the wind and storm surge associated with Gustav.,22067,32.82,-91.8

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish.

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.   Approximately 75% of the damage was estimated to be related to wind - $11.8 million.

This depression moved northwest over the Yucatan Peninsula and emerged over the south central Gulf of Mexico on July 4.  On July 5th the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and moved north toward the southeast Louisiana coast.  Cindy made landfall in southeast Louisiana early on July 6th just to the west of Grand Isle, and reached minimal hurricane strength for a short period of time. Cindy then turned toward the northeast and moved over the New Orleans area and toward the Mississippi coast before dissipating inland over central Alabama later that day.  Cindy initially was classified as a tropical storm, but was later upgraded to a minimal hurricane based primarily on doppler radar wind estimates of a small area of hurricane force winds just east of the path of the hurricane in the coastal waters and extreme southeast coastal sections.  Most of southeast Louisiana, including the metro New Orleans area experience long duration of tropical storm force winds and high gusts that resulted in considerable wind damage to trees and foliage as well as widespread power outages due to downed electrical lines.  An estimated 278,000 electrical customers experienced power outages. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at the New Orleans Lakefront for five and a half hours starting around 11 pm CDT on July 5th with gusts greater than 55 mph recorded each hour during this period. The maximum sustained wind at the Lakefront Airport was 54 mph, or 47 knots, at 300 AM CDT on July 6th.  A peak gust of 70 mph, or 61 knots,  was recorded at the airport at 116 am CDT on July 6th.  This was the highest wind gust measured during the storm over land areas with the exception of 74 mph, or 64 knots, along the coast at the elevated Burwood CMAN station at 149 am CDT on July 6th.  A gust to 69 mph, or 60 knots, was also recorded at the NOAA C-Man station at Grand Isle. The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 55 mph, or 48 knots, at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle. Heavy rainfall resulted in extensive street flooding with rainfall generally amounts ranging from 3 to a little over 6 inches across much of extreme southeast Louisiana.  The lowest pressure measured in southeast Louisiana were 997.3 mb at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle and also at the LSU Citrus Agricultural Station near Port Sulphur.  High tides caused storm surge flooding and beach erosion at Grand Isle.  The highest storm surge recorded was 5.5 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupree near Lake Borgne.Overall Hurricane Cindy caused approximately $50 million in damage in southeast Louisiana; with $2.5 million from storm surge and the remainder from wind damage.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",No entry,22069,31.73,-93.1

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.",Hurricane Gustav affected around 35 homes in lower Plaquemines Parish with 3 receiving major damage and the remainder minor damage. A few businesses also received damage and some trees and utility poles were knocked down. The damage was caused by both the high winds and storm surge associated with Gustav.,22069,31.73,-93.1

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22069,31.73,-93.1

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana.

Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion.

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.","Hurricane Gustav affected around 600 homes in upper Terrebonne Parish with about 20 homes being destroyed, 40 receiving major damage, and 150 minor damage. Damage estimates were from parish government agencies. Many businesses also received damage and numerous trees and utility poles were knocked down. Most of the damage was caused by the high winds associated with Gustav.",22065,32.37,-91.24

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22065,32.37,-91.24

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",No entry,22039,30.73,-92.41

This depression moved northwest over the Yucatan Peninsula and emerged over the south central Gulf of Mexico on July 4.  On July 5th the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and moved north toward the southeast Louisiana coast.  Cindy made landfall in southeast Louisiana early on July 6th just to the west of Grand Isle, and reached minimal hurricane strength for a short period of time. Cindy then turned toward the northeast and moved over the New Orleans area and toward the Mississippi coast before dissipating inland over central Alabama later that day.  Cindy initially was classified as a tropical storm, but was later upgraded to a minimal hurricane based primarily on doppler radar wind estimates of a small area of hurricane force winds just east of the path of the hurricane in the coastal waters and extreme southeast coastal sections.  Most of southeast Louisiana, including the metro New Orleans area experience long duration of tropical storm force winds and high gusts that resulted in considerable wind damage to trees and foliage as well as widespread power outages due to downed electrical lines.  An estimated 278,000 electrical customers experienced power outages. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at the New Orleans Lakefront for five and a half hours starting around 11 pm CDT on July 5th with gusts greater than 55 mph recorded each hour during this period. The maximum sustained wind at the Lakefront Airport was 54 mph, or 47 knots, at 300 AM CDT on July 6th.  A peak gust of 70 mph, or 61 knots,  was recorded at the airport at 116 am CDT on July 6th.  This was the highest wind gust measured during the storm over land areas with the exception of 74 mph, or 64 knots, along the coast at the elevated Burwood CMAN station at 149 am CDT on July 6th.  A gust to 69 mph, or 60 knots, was also recorded at the NOAA C-Man station at Grand Isle. The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 55 mph, or 48 knots, at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle.

The lowest pressure measured in southeast Louisiana were 997.3 mb at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle and also at the LSU Citrus Agricultural Station near Port Sulphur.  High tides caused storm surge flooding and beach erosion at Grand Isle.  The highest storm surge recorded was 5.5 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupree near Lake Borgne.Overall Hurricane Cindy caused approximately $50 million in damage in southeast Louisiana; with $2.5 million from storm surge and the remainder from wind damage.

A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.",Hurricane Gustav affected about 5 homes with all of them receiving minor or very minor damage. Several trees and utility poles were knocked down. The damage was caused by high wind gusts associated with Gustav.,22039,30.73,-92.41

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22039,30.73,-92.41

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",No entry,22047,30.26,-91.35

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.

The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.","Hurricane Gustav affected nearly 300 homes with 5 homes being destroyed, 20 receiving major damage, and 29 minor damage.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.","Hurricane Gustav affected 37 homes with 4 homes being destroyed, 5 receiving major damage, and 2 minor damage.

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22035,32.73,-91.24

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana.

The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22037,30.85,-91.05

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",No entry,22057,29.49,-90.4

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.","Hurricane Gustav affected over 500 homes with 5 homes being destroyed, 3 receiving major damage, and 138 minor damage. Many businesses also received damage and numerous trees and utility poles were knocked down. The damage was caused by the high winds associated with Gustav.",22057,29.49,-90.4

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.

This depression moved northwest over the Yucatan Peninsula and emerged over the south central Gulf of Mexico on July 4.  On July 5th the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and moved north toward the southeast Louisiana coast.  Cindy made landfall in southeast Louisiana early on July 6th just to the west of Grand Isle, and reached minimal hurricane strength for a short period of time. Cindy then turned toward the northeast and moved over the New Orleans area and toward the Mississippi coast before dissipating inland over central Alabama later that day.  Cindy initially was classified as a tropical storm, but was later upgraded to a minimal hurricane based primarily on doppler radar wind estimates of a small area of hurricane force winds just east of the path of the hurricane in the coastal waters and extreme southeast coastal sections.  Most of southeast Louisiana, including the metro New Orleans area experience long duration of tropical storm force winds and high gusts that resulted in considerable wind damage to trees and foliage as well as widespread power outages due to downed electrical lines.  An estimated 278,000 electrical customers experienced power outages. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at the New Orleans Lakefront for five and a half hours starting around 11 pm CDT on July 5th with gusts greater than 55 mph recorded each hour during this period. The maximum sustained wind at the Lakefront Airport was 54 mph, or 47 knots, at 300 AM CDT on July 6th.  A peak gust of 70 mph, or 61 knots,  was recorded at the airport at 116 am CDT on July 6th.  This was the highest wind gust measured during the storm over land areas with the exception of 74 mph, or 64 knots, along the coast at the elevated Burwood CMAN station at 149 am CDT on July 6th.  A gust to 69 mph, or 60 knots, was also recorded at the NOAA C-Man station at Grand Isle. The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 55 mph, or 48 knots, at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle. Heavy rainfall resulted in extensive street flooding with rainfall generally amounts ranging from 3 to a little over 6 inches across much of extreme southeast Louisiana.  The lowest pressure measured in southeast Louisiana were 997.3 mb at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle and also at the LSU Citrus Agricultural Station near Port Sulphur.  High tides caused storm surge flooding and beach erosion at Grand Isle.  The highest storm surge recorded was 5.5 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupree near Lake Borgne.Overall Hurricane Cindy caused approximately $50 million in damage in southeast Louisiana; with $2.5 million from storm surge and the remainder from wind damage.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",No entry,22061,32.6,-92.66

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.",Hurricane Gustav affected several homes in the upper portion of Jefferson Parish with most of the damage being minor. Some businesses also received damage and several trees and utility poles were knocked down. The damage was caused by the high winds associated with Gustav.,22061,32.6,-92.66

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22061,32.6,-92.66

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana.

Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.   Approximately 75% of the damage was estimated to be related to wind - $11.8 million.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",No entry,22063,30.44,-90.73

Gustav tracked northwestward across the Gulf toward Louisiana and made landfall as a category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana during the morning of September 1st. Gustav continued to move northwest across south Louisiana and weakened to a Category 1 storm over south central Louisiana later that day. The storm diminished to a tropical depression over northwestern Louisiana on September 2nd. ||The highest wind gust recorded was 102 knots or 117 mph at a USGS site at the Houma Navigational Canal and at the Pilot Station Est C-MAN at near the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The highest sustained wind of 91 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East C-MAN site. |However, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred. The minimum sea level pressure measured was 951.6 millibars at a USGS site at Caillou Lake southwest of Dulac and 954.5 millibars at the LUMCON facility near Dulac. Rainfall varied considerably across southeast Louisiana ranging from around 4 inches to just over 11 inches.||Gustav produced widespread wind damage across southeast Louisiana, especially in the area from Houma and Thibodaux through the greater Baton Rouge area. Hurricane force wind gusts occurred across the inland areas through the Baton Rouge area and surrounding parishes. A peak wind gust of 91 mph was recorded at the Baton Rouge (Ryan Field) Airport at 112 PM CST. This was only one mph less than the highest wind gust recorded during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  The electric utility serving most of southeast Louisiana reported 75 to 100 percent of utility customers were without power after the storm from Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes northwest through the Baton Rouge area to southwest Mississippi and central Louisiana. Considerable damage occurred to many houses and structures as large tree limbs and trees were toppled by the hurricane force winds. Preliminary estimates from the American Red Cross indicated that around 13,000 single family dwellings were damaged by the hurricane in southeast Louisiana, and several thousand more apartments and mobile homes. Early estimates from Louisiana Economic Development indicated that Gustav caused at least $4.5 billion in property damage in Louisiana, including insured and uninsured losses.   ||A storm surge of 5 to 8 feet above normal occurred along the coast from the mouth of Mississippi River westward through Terrebonne Parish. The highest storm surge of 8 to 12 feet above normal occurred more distant to the east, on the east side of the Mississippi River Delta, from the Mouth of Mississippi River to the Mississippi-Louisiana border. Storm surge around Lake Pontchartrain was generally 4 to 5 feet above normal. Storm surge affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. However, some locally built levees were breached or overtopped.  ||Three tornadoes occurred on the 2nd of September from feeder bands over the area as remnants of Gustav passed well north of the area. The most significant of the tornadoes occurred on west bank areas of Jefferson Parish where several structures suffered heavy damage.||Rainfall run-off was great enough to produce moderate flooding at some locations along the Amite and Comite Rivers in the Baton Rouge area, and along the Bogue Falaya River in the Covington area.",Hurricane Gustav affected around 25 homes in upper Plaquemines Parish with most of them only receiving minor damage. A few businesses also received damage and some trees and utility poles were knocked down. Most of the damage was caused by high winds associated with Gustav.,22063,30.44,-90.73

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22063,30.44,-90.73

As Claudette passed the Yucatan Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico on Friday July 12th, the steering currents relaxed and she slowed her northwesterly movement. Claudette produced tropical storm force winds and heavy rains primarily on her eastern quadrant, which spanned a large portion of the central Gulf and produced wave heights up to 15 feet.  As early as Sunday July 13th large swells were reaching the sand dunes on Padre Island.  Claudette wobbled slowly toward the middle Texas coast in very weak steering currents.  The upper level shear in this system relaxed as expected providing the environment for Claudette to strengthen into a Hurricane. Claudette made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson Scale near Port O'Connor, Texas (Calhoun County) on Tuesday July 15th around 1030 am.  Just prior to landfall storm surge was 5 feet at Port O'Connor in combination with high astronomical tides.  Wind speeds along the Northern Coastal Bend were generally sustained around 65 mph at landfall with gusts to 80 mph.  Maximum sustained winds at the time of landfall were estimated by the National Hurricane Center at 90 mph.  The Formosa Plant in Point Comfort recorded maximum sustained winds of 80 mph with a gust to 100 mph.  The minimum central pressure of Claudette at the time of landfall was 981 MB (28.37 Inches).  Claudette produced a brief tornado in Port Lavaca.  Damage was not attributed directly to this tornado, rather to the hurricane winds.Claudette continued inland during the afternoon of the 15th across Victoria, Goliad and Bee counties weakening to a Tropical Storm.  Claudette continued moving west across Live Oak, McMullen and La Salle counties during the evening and into EWX CWA.  Claudette continued into Northwestern Mexico and into the Big Bend of Texas before dissipating on July 17th.Damages for all of Texas at the time of this writing stood at 45.7 million dollars in uninsured losses and 90.0 million in insured losses.  These losses do not include crop damage, which were still pending at the time of this writing.  In the State of Texas two indirect fatalities were also attributed to Claudette and six indirect injuries.  One of the indirect fatalities occurred in the CRP CWA in Victoria when a woman was killed by a falling tree limb while surveying damage to her house.  Over twenty thousand homes received damage across the CRP County Warning Area, most of which was classified as minor damage in Victoria County.  Over six hundred homes received major damage, again most of which occurred in Victoria County.  Over sixty homes were completely destroyed, mostly in Calhoun County.The heaviest rainfall with Claudette fell across Bee, Goliad and Refugio Counties.  Widespread 4 to 6 inch amounts were estimated across these counties by CRP WSR-88D.  Elsewhere along the path of Claudette totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches.

Harvey was the first category 4 hurricane to strike Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961. Harvey severely affected the cities of Rockport, Fulton, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Holiday Beach, and Refugio. Minor to moderate damage occurred in cities of Portland, Corpus Christi, Seadrift, Woodsboro, Port Lavaca, Goliad, and Victoria.||Harvey weakened to a tropical wave as the system moved across the Caribbean Sea and the Yucatan peninsula from August 18th until the 22nd. Harvey formed into a tropical depression over the southern Gulf of Mexico on the morning of August 23rd. Harvey rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in 40 hours as it moved northwest toward the Texas coast. Harvey continued to intensify as it approached the Middle Texas coast on August 25th and made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane during the evening hours. Harvey was the first major hurricane to make landfall on the Middle Texas coast since Hurricane Celia in August of 1970. ||Hurricane Harvey slowed down after landfall and weakened into a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 26th. Tropical Storm Harvey became nearly stationary west of Cuero from the evening of the 26th through the morning of the 27th. Harvey drifted southeastward across the Victoria Crossroads on the afternoon of the 27th. Harvey then moved into Matagorda Bay during the morning hours of the 28th and back into northwest Gulf of Mexico later that afternoon. Tropical storm conditions persisted near the northern portion of the Middle Texas coast into the early morning hours of the 29th.||Hurricane Harvey moved inland in Aransas County on San Jose Island around 830 PM CDT August 25th. Harvey had a minimum central pressure of 938 millibars and produced a maximum storm surge of 12.5 feet. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 130 mph (115 knots) with gusts to 160 mph (140 knots).  In South Texas, the maximum recorded rainfall from Hurricane Harvey was 17.08 inches 4 miles northwest of Victoria. Radar estimates were close to 20 inches over eastern portions of Refugio County. The height of the storm tide, referenced to mean higher high water, ranged from 3 to 5 feet on northern Padre Island and around Port O'Connor to a maximum of 12.5 feet in northeast Aransas County in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge near San Antonio Bay. Storm tide levels in the interior bays were generally from 5 to 8 feet with higher amounts near 10 feet on the south end of Copano Bay, the north end of Aransas Bay, and the north end of Lavaca Bay. ||There were no direct fatalities from Hurricane Harvey on the Middle Texas Coast. There were 2 indirect fatalities in Rockport and 1 near Bloomington. All of the associated affects from Hurricane Harvey in South Texas from August 25th to August 27th resulted in 14 injuries, $4.5 billion in property damage, and around $65 million in crop damage. Specifically in South Texas, Harvey's inland flooding resulted in $5 million in property damage. One tornado near Seadrift resulted in $10 thousand in property damage. The powerful winds resulted in 14 injuries, $4 billion in property damage, and $65 million in crop damage. The storm tide resulted in $530 million in property damage and a number of drowned livestock. Damage estimates to public property and infrastructure was $130 million in South Texas.||Hurricane Harvey blew down or damaged around 550 power transmission structures. American Electric Power (AEP) repaired or replaced around 5000 distribution poles that were blown down or damaged by Harvey. Almost four million total feet of transmission and distribution conductor were replaced, approximately 712 miles. Power was restored to around 200,000 customers within 2 weeks.||In Aransas County, widespread major damage occurred across the county with a few areas having catastrophic damage. Catastrophic damage was located across Copano Village, Holiday Beach, and Lamar with many homes, some elevated, with second stories completely collapsed. Nearly every structure was greatly impacted. A couple of brick homes were destroyed near Copano Village. Catastrophic damage occurred to homes in the Copano Ridge area. Nearly all the trees in the Holiday Beach, Lamar, and Goose Island State Park area were without leaves with many trees snapped or uprooted. Most of Rockport and Fulton experienced widespread major structural damage. Several homes in the Key Allegro subdivision collapsed. Exterior walls collapsed on the high school gymnasium, on several churches, and on several new hotels. Upper floors of several apartment buildings were removed. Mobile homes and recreational vehicles were demolished. Billboard signs were blown down. Numerous power poles were blown down or snapped. Six hangars were demolished at the Aransas County Airport along with many airplanes. The county remained without power for 2 to 3 weeks. A mesonet wind sensor at Aransas County Airport recorded sustained winds around 110 mph with a peak gust to 150 mph. Nearly 1500 homes were destroyed, almost 3800 homes suffered major damage, and 5350 homes suffered minor damage. There were 175 businesses with major damage. Storm surge greatly impacted Holiday Beach and Copano Village. The surge punched holes through walls and garage doors on the lower portions of most homes. The surge floated vehicles, recreational vehicles, and boats well inland.

The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Florence became a tropical depression near Cape Verde on August 31 and progressed west-northwest, becoming a Tropical Storm on September 1. Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm's winds to gradually weaken over the next few days. However, the storm's wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach early on Saturday September 15, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland.||Florence produced extensive wind damage along the North Carolina coast from Cape Lookout, across Carteret, Onslow, Pender and New Hanover counties. Thousands of downed trees caused widespread power outages to nearly all of eastern North Carolina. The historic legacy of Hurricane Florence will be record breaking storm surge of 9 to 13 feet and widespread devastating rainfall of 20 to 30 inches, locally up to 36 inches, which produced catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. The hardest hit areas included New Bern, Newport, Belhaven, Oriental, North Topsail Beach and Jacksonville, along with Downeast Carteret County, or basically south of a line from Kinston to Cedar Island.

The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Florence became a tropical depression near Cape Verde on August 31 and progressed west-northwest, becoming a Tropical Storm on September 1. Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm's winds to gradually weaken over the next few days. However, the storm's wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach early on Saturday September 15, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland.||Florence produced extensive wind damage along the North Carolina coast from Cape Lookout, across Carteret, Onslow, Pender and New Hanover counties. Thousands of downed trees caused widespread power outages to nearly all of eastern North Carolina. The historic legacy of Hurricane Florence will be record breaking storm surge of 9 to 13 feet and widespread devastating rainfall of 20 to 30 inches, locally up to 36 inches, which produced catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. The hardest hit areas included New Bern, Newport, Belhaven, Oriental, North Topsail Beach and Jacksonville, along with Downeast Carteret County, or basically south of a line from Kinston to Cedar Island. A storm total rainfall of 34.00 inches was reported in Swansboro, while the NWS office in Newport recorded 25.20 inches.  Wind gusts of 106 mph were reported at Cape Lookout with 105 mph at Fort Macon.","A first ever, county wide mandatory evacuation was issued prior to Florence.   Widespread heavy rain and strong winds developed over the region from the morning of September 13th through the morning of September 16th.  Rainfall was generally 8��� to 12��� over the north part of the county north of New Bern, with 15��� to 20��� south of New Bern over the south part of the County.  Trent Woods had a storm total of 17.35���.  Extremely heavy rainfall across the county initially lead to flash flooding with numerous roads that were impassable.  Extreme rainfall led to flooding along the Neuse River with many homes and roads being inundated on the north side of the river above New Bern.  Gusty northeast winds developed ahead of Florence as the storm approached the coast, with a peak wind gust of 87 mph at Cherry Point at 845 LST on September 13th. The gusty winds combined with saturated ground led to many downed trees with widespread power outages.  Significant storm surge flooding occurred the evening of Thursday September 13th into the early morning of Friday September 14th along the Neuse River near and in New Bern.  Over 1,800 water recues were performed, many of which were directly related to the storm surge flooding.  Preliminary storm surge values (above ground level) of 5 to 8 were found in River Bend, 6 to 8 feet in Trent Woods, 6 to 10 feet in New Bern, and 6 to 7 feet in Fairfield Harbor.

Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County. Dollar damages totals have not been completed but will likely exceed 200 million dollars with significant agricultural losses.","Widespread heavy rain and strong winds developed over the region from the afternoon of October 8th through the early afternoon of October 9th. Rainfall was generally 6 to 12 inches over Hatteras Island with a storm total of 11.5 inches recorded in Kill Devil Hills. This heavy rain produced significant flash flooding, with  the worst hit area across the northern section where many homes and businesses were flooded between Nags Head and Kill Devil Hills. Strong winds developed on the back side of Matthew during the morning of October 9th. Many locations had gusts between 70 and 80 mph with a peak gust of 90 mph recorded at 717 am by a National Ocean Service station at Oregon Inlet. These strong winds produced some structural damages and downed power lines. Storm surge inundation on the ocean side was generally 1 to 3 feet above ground producing significant beach erosion. On the sound side storm surge inundation reached 3 to 5 feet above ground level with the highest levels near Hatteras Village. Significant damage was done to many homes and businesses by this flooding. The lowest pressure recorded was 984.4 mb by a meso net site near Hatteras.",37103,35.01,-77.37

The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Florence became a tropical depression near Cape Verde on August 31 and progressed west-northwest, becoming a Tropical Storm on September 1. Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm's winds to gradually weaken over the next few days. However, the storm's wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach early on Saturday September 15, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland.||Florence produced extensive wind damage along the North Carolina coast from Cape Lookout, across Carteret, Onslow, Pender and New Hanover counties. Thousands of downed trees caused widespread power outages to nearly all of eastern North Carolina. The historic legacy of Hurricane Florence will be record breaking storm surge of 9 to 13 feet and widespread devastating rainfall of 20 to 30 inches, locally up to 36 inches, which produced catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. The hardest hit areas included New Bern, Newport, Belhaven, Oriental, North Topsail Beach and Jacksonville, along with Downeast Carteret County, or basically south of a line from Kinston to Cedar Island. A storm total rainfall of 34.00 inches was reported in Swansboro, while the NWS office in Newport recorded 25.20 inches.  Wind gusts of 106 mph were reported at Cape Lookout with 105 mph at Fort Macon.","Widespread heavy rain and strong winds developed over the region from the morning of September 13th through the evening of September 15th.  Rainfall was generally 1��� to 2��� over most of the county but 5��� to 6��� fell over the southern part of Hatteras Island (southern Outer Banks, Dare).  Frisco had a storm total of 6.26���.  Heavy rainfall across the southern part of the county led to flash flooding with some roads impassable.  Gusty east winds developed ahead of Florence as the storm approached the coast, with a peak wind gust of 79 mph at Frisco Woods at 445 PM LST on September 13th. The gusty winds combined with saturated ground led to some downed trees with and power outages.",37103,35.01,-77.37

As Claudette passed the Yucatan Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico on Friday July 12th, the steering currents relaxed and she slowed her northwesterly movement. Claudette produced tropical storm force winds and heavy rains primarily on her eastern quadrant, which spanned a large portion of the central Gulf and produced wave heights up to 15 feet.  As early as Sunday July 13th large swells were reaching the sand dunes on Padre Island.  Claudette wobbled slowly toward the middle Texas coast in very weak steering currents.  The upper level shear in this system relaxed as expected providing the environment for Claudette to strengthen into a Hurricane. Claudette made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson Scale near Port O'Connor, Texas (Calhoun County) on Tuesday July 15th around 1030 am.  Just prior to landfall storm surge was 5 feet at Port O'Connor in combination with high astronomical tides.  Wind speeds along the Northern Coastal Bend were generally sustained around 65 mph at landfall with gusts to 80 mph.  Maximum sustained winds at the time of landfall were estimated by the National Hurricane Center at 90 mph.  The Formosa Plant in Point Comfort recorded maximum sustained winds of 80 mph with a gust to 100 mph.  The minimum central pressure of Claudette at the time of landfall was 981 MB (28.37 Inches).  Claudette produced a brief tornado in Port Lavaca.  Damage was not attributed directly to this tornado, rather to the hurricane winds.Claudette continued inland during the afternoon of the 15th across Victoria, Goliad and Bee counties weakening to a Tropical Storm.  Claudette continued moving west across Live Oak, McMullen and La Salle counties during the evening and into EWX CWA.  Claudette continued into Northwestern Mexico and into the Big Bend of Texas before dissipating on July 17th.Damages for all of Texas at the time of this writing stood at 45.7 million dollars in uninsured losses and 90.0 million in insured losses.  These losses do not include crop damage, which were still pending at the time of this writing.  In the State of Texas two indirect fatalities were also attributed to Claudette and six indirect injuries.  One of the indirect fatalities occurred in the CRP CWA in Victoria when a woman was killed by a falling tree limb while surveying damage to her house.  Over twenty thousand homes received damage across the CRP County Warning Area, most of which was classified as minor damage in Victoria County.  Over six hundred homes received major damage, again most of which occurred in Victoria County.  Over sixty homes were completely destroyed, mostly in Calhoun County.The heaviest rainfall with Claudette fell across Bee, Goliad and Refugio Counties.  Widespread 4 to 6 inch amounts were estimated across these counties by CRP WSR-88D.  Elsewhere along the path of Claudette totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches.  Further south in CRP southern CWA totals remained under 1 inch expect for a thin band of 4 to 6 inch amounts stretching from the Padre Island National Seashore north into Refugio County.",No entry,48247,27.05,-98.68

Claudette moved northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico on July 12th, then meandered over the central Gulf of Mexico on July 13th. A general north-northwestward motion followed on July 14th and Claudette slowly intensified during this time. Claudette reached hurricane strength on July 15th as it turned west-northwestward. This motion brought the center to the Texas coast at Port O'Connor that morning as a 90 mph Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Claudette turned westward after landfall, moving across portions of southern Texas and northern Mexico. The cyclone turned west-northwestward across northwestern Mexico and the Texas Big Bend area before dissipating on July 17th. Damage was observed across most Southeastern Texas coastal counties. Major beach erosion was observed from High Island to Freeport. Large geo-tubes on Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula did significantly reduce erosion. Coastal roads along the west end of Galveston Bay were under water due to tidal flooding. Further south in Matagorda County, major beach erosion was observed in the Sargent area. Tides in the west Matagorda Bay area were minimal. Water was pushed out of Matagorda Bay as Claudette approached and did not have adequate time to generate a large surge once the winds became east and then southeast.In Chambers County, lowland flooding was observed on the eastern shore of Galveston Bay within the communities of Smith Point, Oak Island, White Heron Estates, Cedar Point and Beach City.

Rita was a Category 3 hurricane at landfall.Two and a half weeks after Hurricane Katrina made her final and devastating landfall along the northern Gulf coast, all eyes turned to Tropical Storm Rita as she moved westward through the central Bahamas. On Tuesday, September 20th, Rita rapidly intensified while moving west through the Florida Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita reached Category 2 intensity as the center passed about 50 miles south of Key West and significantly impacted the Florida Keys. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Rita intensified at an astounding rate going from Category 2 to Category 5 intensity in 24 hours. Following this rapid intensification period, sustained winds reached 165 mph on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 21st. Since early Monday, Rita had been consistently forecast to make landfall along the upper southeast Texas coast, when the 120 hour forecast from the National Hurricane Center depicted a landfall near San Luis Pass. Emergency management officials, members of the media, and residents of southeast Texas had been watching Rita closely and planning their course of action on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day.The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas. Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger.Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed.Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain.All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way. In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly. In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days. Minor damage was reported in Surfside to roads and a few homes. Total damage was around $500,000.In Montgomery County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $2.5 million. There were 13 indirect fatalities. Ten of the deaths were evacuation related while 3 deaths were carbon monoxide poisoning with no electricity in the home.In Walker County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $1.5 million.   In Galveston County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts to hurricane force were reported across the county, especially on the Bolivar Peninsula. Numerous power poles and road signs were blown down on Bolivar. Many of the beach homes received roof damage. Numerous trees were down with small structure damage on High Island. Power was out to most of the county on Saturday. In Galveston's historic district, a large brick-covered side of a three-story building collapsed and three other buildings caught fire and were destroyed during the height of the storm. There were three directly related injuries. A thirty-year-old woman suffered severe burns in the fire and two firefighters had minor injuries. Small structure, dock, and pier damage along with downed power lines occurred across Galveston Island. Total damage across the county was around $15 million.In Chambers County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. One frame building near Winnie received major damage. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $8 million. One indirect fatality occurred in the county.In Liberty County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $7 million. There were two direct fatalities. In Hardin, a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on the home they were sleeping in. In Polk and San Jacinto Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Widespread trees were down with many trees taking down power lines. Some trees fell onto homes and caused considerable damage. Widespread power outages were observed across both counties. Lake Livingston Dam reported a wind gust of 117 mph around 5:30 AM Saturday morning. This wind sensor was on the dam and the wind was blowing across the lake. With the reduced friction across the lake's surface, this wind gust report is reasonable. The strong wind blowing along the lake created a storm surge of approximately 1.5 feet at the dam. This high water and the wave action damaged the dam which required emergency releases from the lake to stabilize the dam. The damage in Polk County was around $23 million with $20 million of that being damage to the dam at Lake Livingston. Damage in San Jacinto County was estimated at $10 million. There was one direct fatality in San Jacinto County. A three-year-old female was killed instantly by a tree falling on to her home in Point Blank. In Houston and Trinity Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near 50 mph were observed. Numerous trees were down resulting in numerous power outages. One heat related indirect death occurred in Houston County during the evacuation. Total damage for both Houston and Trinity counties was near $2 million.No tornadoes were reported with Rita. Maximum rainfall amounts with Rita were between 4 and 6 inches in and around the New Caney area of Montgomery County.",No entry,48237,33.24,-98.18

Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County. The majority of property damage at the coast was a result of storm tide. ||Collectively, damage amounts are estimated to be near 14 billion dollars over the counties of Harris, Chambers, Galveston, Liberty, Polk, Matagorda, Brazoria, Fort Bend, San Jacinto, and Montgomery with an estimated 8 billion of that due to storm surge in coastal Galveston, Harris and Chambers Counties. Fresh water flooding also occurred near the city of Houston where up to 14 inches of rain fell over a two day period, first from Ike, then from a line of thunderstorms associated with a cold front moving through the following day. The number of fatalities directly related to Ike was 12 in the aforementioned counties with 11 of those occurring in Galveston County from drowning due to the storm surge. In addition, there were at least 25 fatalities indirectly related to Ike, either due to carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, accidents while clearing debris, or house fires from candles. There were no known tornadoes associated with Ike.","Ike produced damage due to high storm surge and high winds over the region.

A general north-northwestward motion followed on July 14th and Claudette slowly intensified during this time. Claudette reached hurricane strength on July 15th as it turned west-northwestward. This motion brought the center to the Texas coast at Port O'Connor that morning as a 90 mph Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Claudette turned westward after landfall, moving across portions of southern Texas and northern Mexico. The cyclone turned west-northwestward across northwestern Mexico and the Texas Big Bend area before dissipating on July 17th. Damage was observed across most Southeastern Texas coastal counties. Major beach erosion was observed from High Island to Freeport. Large geo-tubes on Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula did significantly reduce erosion. Coastal roads along the west end of Galveston Bay were under water due to tidal flooding. Further south in Matagorda County, major beach erosion was observed in the Sargent area. Tides in the west Matagorda Bay area were minimal. Water was pushed out of Matagorda Bay as Claudette approached and did not have adequate time to generate a large surge once the winds became east and then southeast.In Chambers County, lowland flooding was observed on the eastern shore of Galveston Bay within the communities of Smith Point, Oak Island, White Heron Estates, Cedar Point and Beach City. In Harris County, flooding was observed in the low-lying areas along the western shore of Galveston Bay (Seabrook and La Porte).In Galveston County, 38 single family homes were destroyed, 25 received major damage, and 964 received minor damage. 33 businesses were affected with damage costs of an estimated $970,000. Total damage, including beach erosion, was estimated at $8.3 million. The highest recorded tide level, 7.56 feet above mean low-lower water, occurred around sunrise on the 15th at Pleasure Pier.In Brazoria County, 2 single family homes were destroyed, 10 received major damage, and 39 received minor damage. 2 businesses were destroyed and 9 received major damage totaling $655,000. Total damage, including beach erosion, was estimated at $1.27 million. The highest recorded tide level, 6.99 feet above mean low-lower water, occurred in Freeport at the Brazos River levee on the morning of the 15th.In Matagorda County, 85 homes and 75 mobile homes were destroyed. 70 homes and 26 mobile homes received major damage. 105 homes and 117 mobile homes received minor damage. 52 businesses were destroyed or received major damage and 50 businesses received minor damage. One tornado (F1) damaged a couple buildings at the Baptist Youth Camp in Palacios. Total storm damage was estimated at $716,300. The highest recorded tide level occurred at the Colorado River Locks at Matagorda where the tide level reached 8.00 feet above mean low-lower water on the morning of the 15th.In Jackson County, all damage was wind related. Numerous homes suffered roof damage and numerous trees were down in the southern portion of the county. 4 single family homes were destroyed, 13 suffered major damage and 38 had minor damage. One business received major damage from wind. There were two injuries. Total damage was estimated at $593,860.The highest reported wind gust was at the South Texas Nuclear Power Plant in Matagorda County where an 86 mph wind gust was recorded at 1000 CDT on July 15th.

Rita was a Category 3 hurricane at landfall.Two and a half weeks after Hurricane Katrina made her final and devastating landfall along the northern Gulf coast, all eyes turned to Tropical Storm Rita as she moved westward through the central Bahamas. On Tuesday, September 20th, Rita rapidly intensified while moving west through the Florida Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita reached Category 2 intensity as the center passed about 50 miles south of Key West and significantly impacted the Florida Keys. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Rita intensified at an astounding rate going from Category 2 to Category 5 intensity in 24 hours. Following this rapid intensification period, sustained winds reached 165 mph on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 21st. Since early Monday, Rita had been consistently forecast to make landfall along the upper southeast Texas coast, when the 120 hour forecast from the National Hurricane Center depicted a landfall near San Luis Pass. Emergency management officials, members of the media, and residents of southeast Texas had been watching Rita closely and planning their course of action on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day.The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas. Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger.Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed.Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain.All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way. In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly. In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days. Minor damage was reported in Surfside to roads and a few homes. Total damage was around $500,000.In Montgomery County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $2.5 million. There were 13 indirect fatalities. Ten of the deaths were evacuation related while 3 deaths were carbon monoxide poisoning with no electricity in the home.In Walker County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $1.5 million.   In Galveston County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts to hurricane force were reported across the county, especially on the Bolivar Peninsula. Numerous power poles and road signs were blown down on Bolivar. Many of the beach homes received roof damage. Numerous trees were down with small structure damage on High Island. Power was out to most of the county on Saturday. In Galveston's historic district, a large brick-covered side of a three-story building collapsed and three other buildings caught fire and were destroyed during the height of the storm. There were three directly related injuries. A thirty-year-old woman suffered severe burns in the fire and two firefighters had minor injuries. Small structure, dock, and pier damage along with downed power lines occurred across Galveston Island. Total damage across the county was around $15 million.In Chambers County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. One frame building near Winnie received major damage. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $8 million. One indirect fatality occurred in the county.In Liberty County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $7 million. There were two direct fatalities. In Hardin, a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on the home they were sleeping in. In Polk and San Jacinto Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Widespread trees were down with many trees taking down power lines. Some trees fell onto homes and caused considerable damage. Widespread power outages were observed across both counties. Lake Livingston Dam reported a wind gust of 117 mph around 5:30 AM Saturday morning. This wind sensor was on the dam and the wind was blowing across the lake. With the reduced friction across the lake's surface, this wind gust report is reasonable. The strong wind blowing along the lake created a storm surge of approximately 1.5 feet at the dam. This high water and the wave action damaged the dam which required emergency releases from the lake to stabilize the dam. The damage in Polk County was around $23 million with $20 million of that being damage to the dam at Lake Livingston. Damage in San Jacinto County was estimated at $10 million. There was one direct fatality in San Jacinto County. A three-year-old female was killed instantly by a tree falling on to her home in Point Blank. In Houston and Trinity Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near 50 mph were observed. Numerous trees were down resulting in numerous power outages. One heat related indirect death occurred in Houston County during the evacuation. Total damage for both Houston and Trinity counties was near $2 million.No tornadoes were reported with Rita. Maximum rainfall amounts with Rita were between 4 and 6 inches in and around the New Caney area of Montgomery County.",No entry,48213,32.21,-95.85

At landfall, Ike had a central pressure of 951.6 mb, as measured at Galveston Pleasure Pier, and a maximum estimated storm surge of 17 feet over portions of Chambers County and the Bolivar Peninsula. Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County. The majority of property damage at the coast was a result of storm tide. ||Collectively, damage amounts are estimated to be near 14 billion dollars over the counties of Harris, Chambers, Galveston, Liberty, Polk, Matagorda, Brazoria, Fort Bend, San Jacinto, and Montgomery with an estimated 8 billion of that due to storm surge in coastal Galveston, Harris and Chambers Counties. Fresh water flooding also occurred near the city of Houston where up to 14 inches of rain fell over a two day period, first from Ike, then from a line of thunderstorms associated with a cold front moving through the following day. The number of fatalities directly related to Ike was 12 in the aforementioned counties with 11 of those occurring in Galveston County from drowning due to the storm surge. In addition, there were at least 25 fatalities indirectly related to Ike, either due to carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, accidents while clearing debris, or house fires from candles. There were no known tornadoes associated with Ike.","Ike produced damage due to high storm surge and high winds along the Galveston Bay, Clear Lake and associated tributaries.

Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. Over 2 million customers of Dominion Virginia Power were without electricity. Local electrical cooperatives also reported thousands of customers were without power. Storm surge varied significantly across the region. At Sewells Point, the maximum water level was 7.9 feet above MLLW. This represented a 5 foot storm surge. At Gloucester Point, the water level reached 8.32 feet, representing a 6.4 foot surge. A storm survey indicated a surge around 6.5 feet at Colonial Beach. On the Rappahannock, surge values between 5.5 and 6.0 feet occurred at Tappahannock and downstream near Dunnsville. Even higher surge values were noted up the rivers in eastern Virginia, such as the James, Potomac, York and Rappahannock. Storm surge values around 9 feet were estimated at West Point Virginia. At Richmond City Locks, a more than 8 foot surge was noted, and Smithfield also recorded an 8 foot storm surge. An estimated 8 foot surge also occurred near the intersection of the James and Appomattox Rivers in Hopewell. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 987 mb at Portsmouth Virginia. Isabel will be remembered for the greatest wind and storm surge in the region since Hazel in 1954, and the 1933 Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane. Also, Isabel will be remembered for the most extensive power outages ever in Virginia, and permanent change to the landscape from all the fallen trees and storm surge.

Even higher surge values were noted up the rivers in eastern Virginia, such as the James, Potomac, York and Rappahannock. Storm surge values around 9 feet were estimated at West Point Virginia. At Richmond City Locks, a more than 8 foot surge was noted, and Smithfield also recorded an 8 foot storm surge. An estimated 8 foot surge also occurred near the intersection of the James and Appomattox Rivers in Hopewell. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 987 mb at Portsmouth Virginia. Isabel will be remembered for the greatest wind and storm surge in the region since Hazel in 1954, and the 1933 Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane. Also, Isabel will be remembered for the most extensive power outages ever in Virginia, and permanent change to the landscape from all the fallen trees and storm surge. Rainfall amounts ranged from 1.5 to 5 inches across eastern, and southeast Virginia. Toano in James City county reported 10.60 inches. Inland flooding due to heavy rainfall occurred over parts of eastern and southeast Virginia. Significant beach erosion occurred across Newport News and Hampton. In Virginia Beach, 15th street fishing pier was significantly damaged, and Buckroe and Lynnhaven Piers were destroyed. Significant erosion was also observed as far north as the middle peninsula and northern neck. In addition, many privately owned piers, as well as some public piers were damaged or destroyed by storm surge and/or wave impacts in this region. Eight deaths can be directly attributed to Isabel in the Wakefield area of responsibility, with 7 in Virginia. There were more than 15 deaths indirectly attributed to the storm.",No entry,51099,38.26,-77.15

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage across coastal Mississippi was catastrophic.  The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate 10.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, signage,  downed tress, and some windows were broken by wind and wind driven debris In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines.  Damage was less extensive in southwest Mississippi.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Mississippi were estimated at 9.8 billion dollars. Uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars across the Gulf Coast.As of late October the following fatality figures were reported in the Mississippi coastal counties; Hancock- 52, Harrison - 83, Jackson - 17. Additional details on fatalities will be given in later updates to storm data.Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  The lowest pressure on the Mississippi coast was estimated to be 928 mb where the hurricane made landfall near the Louisiana Mississippi border. A pressure of 976 mb was recorded at 0951 CDT by a university weather station deployed in Pascagoula, well east of the landfall location.  At approximately the same time, the pressure at the NWS office in Slidell, just to the west of landfall location, recorded a pressure of 934.1 mb at 0938 AM CDT. The highest wind gusts recorded in Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters were 117 knots (134 mph) at the Pearl River County EOC office in Poplarville and 102 knots (118 mph) at 1000AM CDT by a university wind tower deployed at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County.  Maximum sustained winds in Mississippi were estimated around 105 knots (121 mph) near the storm's second landfall along the Mississippi and Louisiana border.  Unofficial wind observations before the gage failed included a wind gust of 106 kt, (122 mph) at 0615 CDT by an amateur radio operator in Long Beach and a wind gust of 108 kt (124 mph) at the EOC in Pascagoula. Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 10 to 16 inches across coastal and south Mississippi with much lower amounts observed over southwest Mississippi.

Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.

The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.

Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.   Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb.   Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.     Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours. Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.  The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami.  In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.  Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes.   One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes. Small swaths of greater damage elsewhere in South Florida have not been attributed to tornadoes, but were instead likely caused by  ""mini-swirls"", small vortices within the eye wall that have been observed in previous strong hurricanes such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992.",No entry,12069,28.77,-81.72

The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County. About $255 million came from the agricultural community in Miami-Dade County.||Total number of people who were at county evacuation shelters were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 31,092, Palm Beach County - 17,263, Collier County - 17,040, Broward County - 17,000, Hendry County - 3,000||Total number of customers without power were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 888,530, Broward County - 689,000, Palm Beach County- 566,240, Collier County -  197,630, Hendry County - 9,700, Glades County - 1,670.","Hurricane Irma produced maximum sustained winds near 115 mph at landfall in Marco Island and 80-100 mph across the rest of Coastal Collier County. Wind gusts were in excess of 100 mph, with a peak gust of 142 mph near Naples Regional Airport at 435 PM in association with the eastern eye wall. These winds produced major wind damage with at least 88 buildings destroyed and over 1,500 with major damage. Heavy tree and power pole damage, along with minor structural damage, was observed in areas affected by the eye wall. Post-storm survey revealed the likelihood of mini-vortices in the eastern eye wall causing enhanced tree and structural damage in Port of the Islands and Collier-Seminole State Park.

Widespread storm-total amounts of 3 to 5 inches occurred in southeast and interior south Florida with southwest Florida averaging 1 to 3 inches.  Rainfall flooding was mostly minor except for a few locations in Palm Beach County which had up to 3 feet of standing water.  A section of I-95 in Palm Beach County was closed due to a large sinkhole.The maximum storm surge was estimated to have ranged from 2 to 4 feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to 1 to 2 feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to 5 feet above and below normal. Coastal beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and portions of Broward counties and was minor in Miami-Dade and Collier counties.There were no confirmed tornadoes.There were no known direct deaths, but at least 9 people died in the aftermath.  Six of these deaths occurred in Palm Beach County, mainly as the result of vehicle-related accidents or from drownings.  Two vehicle-related deaths were reported in Broward County and one person died in Collier County while clearing debris.  An unknown number of injuries occurred.Property damage at the coast occurred mainly to marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats.  Inland structure damage included 15,000 houses and 2,400 businesses in Palm Beach County.  Wind damage to house roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, screened enclosures and outbuildings occurred over much of southeast Florida including areas near Lake Okeechobee, but was greatest in Palm Beach County.A preliminary damage estimate for Frances in south Florida is $620 million, including $500 million in Palm Beach, $80 million in Broward, and $34 million in Miami-Dade.  Crop damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at an additional $70 million to sugar cane and vegetables and additional heavy losses occurred to nurseries.Florida Power and Light reported power outages occurred to 659,000 customer in Palm Beach, 590,000 in Broward, 423,000 in Miami-Dade, 39,200 in Collier, 2,500 in Hendry and 1,700 in Collier.

She moved across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then turned north into the Atlantic and became a hurricane on September 20.  Jeanne made a clockwise loop for three days in the Atlantic north of Hispaniola before moving west northwest. It strengthened to a Category 3 Hurricane while over the northwest Bahamas and then make landfall around 11 P.M., September 25 near the south end of Hutchinson Island, nearly coincident with the landfall point of Hurricane Frances nearly three week before.  The 40-mile diameter eye was not quite as large as Frances, but the southern eyewall again affected northeast Palm Beach County.  After landfall Jeanne initially moved along a track similar to Frances, just north of Lake Okeechobee as it weakened to a tropical storm then it turned to the northwest and moved over the northwest Florida Peninsula.Although slightly smaller and stronger then Hurricane Frances, winds and pressures  over southeast Florida were remarkably similar to Frances.  Unfortunately, the ASOS at West Palm Beach International Airport quit sending data during the height of the hurricane. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred over most of Palm Beach and northeast Glades counties and portions of Broward, Hendry and Collier counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, portions of northern Palm Beach County mostly likely experienced them.  A South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) instrument in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee measured a 15-minute sustained wind of 79 mph with a peak gust of 105 mph.  In metropolitan Palm Beach the highest official sustained wind speed was 60 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph from the C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier. An unofficial peak wind gust of 125 mph was measured in West Palm Beach at the Solid Waste Treatment Plant.   In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest sustained wind measured at a SFWMD instrument was 68 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph. Near Clewiston the highest measured sustained wind was 31 mph with a peak wind gust of 72 mph from a SFWMD instrument.  The highest measured sustained wind in Broward County was 46 mph with a peak wind gust of 67 mph from the ASOS site at Pompano Beach Airpark.  At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport the ASOS site measured a maximum sustained wind of 40 mph with a peak gust of 56 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 49 mph with a peak gust of 59 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 26 mph and gusts to 36 mph at Miami International Airport ASOS.  At the Naples Municipal Airport, the ASOS maximum sustained wind was measured at 33 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph.  The lowest barometric pressure of 960.4 mb was measured at a SFWMD site in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee.A SFWMD gage measured a maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 10.22 inches over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  A SFWMD gage about four miles west of West Palm Beach International Airport measured 9.10 inches with 8.79 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period. At Moore Haven, 5.99 inches of rain was measured.  Widespread storm-total amounts of one to four inches occurred in most of southeast and interior south Florida with Miami-Dade County and Collier County averaging one half to one inch. Mostly minor rainfall flooding was observed except locally severe in Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter and in the farmlands of western Palm Beach County.The estimated maximum storm surge ranged from two to four feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to one to two feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to seven feet above and below normal causing severe flooding of some marinas.  Beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and minor in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.There were no confirmed tornadoes.There were no known direct deaths but four persons died in the aftermath.  An unknown number of injuries occurred. Property damage from storm surge and winds at the coast occurred to condos, marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats and a few coastal roadways. Inland wind damage to building roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, and outbuildings occurred over mainly over Palm Beach County and portions of eastern Glades and Hendry counties.A preliminary damage estimate for Jeanne in southeast Florida is $330 million, including $260 million in Palm Beach, $50 million in Broward and $10 million in Miami-Dade.

The western side of Ivan effected a large portion of Eastern Mississippi as the center moved north through Alabama. Thousands of trees were blown down across Eastern Mississippi during the event as well as hundreds of power lines. The strong wind itself did not cause much structural damage, however the fallen trees did. These downed trees accounted for several hundred homes, mobile homes and businesses to be damaged or destroyed. Most locations across Eastern Mississippi reported sustained winds between 30 and 40 mph with Tropical Storm force gusts between 48 and 54 mph. The strongest reported winds occurred in Newton, Lauderdale and Oktibbeha counties. A Mississippi mesonet site, in Newton, reported maximum sustained winds of 42 mph and peak gust of 54 mph.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28033,34.88,-89.99

This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28031,31.63,-89.55

The western side of Ivan effected a large portion of Eastern Mississippi as the center moved north through Alabama. Thousands of trees were blown down across Eastern Mississippi during the event as well as hundreds of power lines. The strong wind itself did not cause much structural damage, however the fallen trees did. These downed trees accounted for several hundred homes, mobile homes and businesses to be damaged or destroyed. Most locations across Eastern Mississippi reported sustained winds between 30 and 40 mph with Tropical Storm force gusts between 48 and 54 mph. The strongest reported winds occurred in Newton, Lauderdale and Oktibbeha counties. A Mississippi mesonet site, in Newton, reported maximum sustained winds of 42 mph and peak gust of 54 mph.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees.

Major Hurricane Dennis impacted portions of the area during the day and evening of July 10th.    The storm made landfall around 130 PM CST as a category three hurricane near Navarre Beach in Santa Rosa county.  Dennis then moved north northwest across Santa Rosa and northeast Escambia county in Florida.  The weakening storm then moved across the west part of Escambia, the south part of Monroe, the east part of Clarke and the northeast part of Choctaw counties in Alabama.  Dennis had a very small eye and winds around the eyewall of the storm caused significant damage as the storm moved north.  An aerial survey of the damage showed a five to ten mile wide area of destruction, with most of the damage east of the eye of the storm.  As Dennis moved north into Alabama the damage diminished and was confined to a smaller area.  A lot of the damage looked like a giant tornado, except the trees were all facing in the same general direction. Coastal counties across the area from Mobile to Destin were put under a Hurricane Watch at 300 PM CST on July 8, then a Hurricane Warning at 300 AM CST on July 9.  An Inland Hurricane Warning was issued for most of the inland counties in Alabama at 436 PM CST on July 9.  Parts of southeast Mississippi were added to the warning during the early morning hours of July 10.  Most of the warnings were dropped at 900 PM CST on July 10 as Dennis weakened as it moved inland.Some of the wind reports from across northwest Florida on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 66 knots with peak gust of 81 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 39 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 46 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 48 knots, peak gust of 72 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  49 knots, peak gust 64 knots.  Crestview, sustained wind of 37 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Navarre, peak gust of 105 knots.  Pensacola (near airport), peak gust 83 knots.  Destin (near airport), peak gust 70 knots. Pace, peak gust 92 knots.  Pensacola (southeast of airport), peak gust 88 knots.  Some of the wind reports across southwest Alabama on July 10 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 32 knots, peak gust of 42 knots.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind at 42 knots, gust to 57 knots.    Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), peak gust 67 knots.  Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Dennis on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport, 956.6 MB.  Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), 986.1 MB.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, 976.6 MB.  Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), 987.8 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport, 990.5 MB.    The highest 48 hour rainfall totals associated with Hurricane Dennis: In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR) 7.67 inches.  Pace, 6.90 inches.  Milton, 7.01 inches.  Munson, 6.93 inches.  Niceville, 5.15 inches.  In Alabama: Bay Minette, 4.65 inches.   Butler 4.36 inches.The highest storm tides from Dennis occurred at: Pensacola with 5.50 feet.  Santa Rosa Sound with 5.00 feet.  Destin with 4.60 feet.  Perdido Pass with 4.10 feet.  Pace with 3.5 feet.  A storm survey measured 6-6.5 feet on Navarre Beach.  Since the eye of Dennis was very small, the highest surge values were near and just to the right of the eye of the storm.  Some higher surge values occurred well east of Destin before Dennis moved ashore.Major beach erosion occurred from Pensacola Beach to east of Destin.  Minor beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to Orange Beach.  Major flash flooding occurred along and east of the center of Dennis during the afternoon and evening of July 10 across northwest Florida and southwest Alabama.    As Dennis moved inland,  tornado like damage occurred near the eyewall of storm.  Almost every structure located on Navarre Beach suffered some kind of damage.  The structures that were located on the beach front all suffered damage.   The Air Force bases at Eglin and Hurlburt reported over a half billion dollars in damage from Dennis.  Almost 200 homes in northwest Florida reported major damage.  Part of U. S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin in Okaloosa county were again washed out by high water.  The west bound lanes were damaged by the surge but the east bound lanes were okay.  It was also estimated that most of this years cotton crop in northwest Florida was damaged.No direct deaths were reported with Dennis, but three indirect deaths were reported.  Two died from Carbon Monoxide poisoning in Escambia county Florida and one from electrocution in Escambia county Alabama.

Thousands of trees were blown down across Eastern Mississippi during the event as well as hundreds of power lines. The strong wind itself did not cause much structural damage, however the fallen trees did. These downed trees accounted for several hundred homes, mobile homes and businesses to be damaged or destroyed. Most locations across Eastern Mississippi reported sustained winds between 30 and 40 mph with Tropical Storm force gusts between 48 and 54 mph. The strongest reported winds occurred in Newton, Lauderdale and Oktibbeha counties. A Mississippi mesonet site, in Newton, reported maximum sustained winds of 42 mph and peak gust of 54 mph. At Key Field in Meridian, maximum sustained winds were reported at 43 mph with a peak gust of 61 mph. The highest sustained and peak wind occurred at the Mississippi State Climate Lab in Starkville. This site reported maximum sustained winds of 52 mph and a peak gust of 64 mph.Overall, rainfall totals were held in check as Ivan steadily moved north.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28051,33.12,-90.09

The hurricane continued northwest and was centered approximately 55 miles east of Stuart at 2300LST. Matthew then paralleled the Florida coast, remaining just offshore as a Category 3 hurricane. The eye reached its closest point of approach to land, only 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral near 0800LST on October 7, and was 35 miles east of Daytona Beach around 1100LST, as it continued moving northwest, just offshore the northeast Florida coast. Hurricane force winds (sustained or frequent gusts) affected coastal areas from Vero Beach northward, extending inland across the mainland portions of Brevard and Volusia Counties, with tropical storm force winds experienced across much of the remainder of east-central Florida. The strongest winds occurred along the coast from Cape Canaveral in Brevard County to north or Ormond-By-The-Sea in Volusia County, where Category 1-2 winds were likely experienced. Two direct hurricane-related fatalities and one direct injury occurred, in addition to nine indirect deaths. Preliminary damage estimates across east-central Florida exceeded $580 million, with $514 million reported in Volusia County alone.||A storm surge of 3-6 feet affected the beaches from near the Indian River/St. Lucie County line northward to the Volusia/Flagler County line, along with moderate to major beach erosion, with the highest surge (5-6 feet) and most significant erosion occurring north of Daytona Beach. Farther south, a surge of 2-3 feet occurred, along with minor to moderate beach erosion.  ||Rainfall totals reached 7-9 inches across parts of Seminole and Volusia Counties, where widespread flooding of streets and low-lying areas occurred. Elsewhere, rainfall totals were generally 2-6 inches, with isolated, minor flooding of poor drainage areas and standing water on roadways.","The center of major Hurricane Matthew passed only 25 miles offshore Brevard County during the morning hours of October 7, producing a long duration of sustained tropical storm winds through much of the county and a shorter period of frequent gusts to hurricane force closer to the coast. A NWS damage survey confirmed that sustained category 1-2 hurricane winds likely occurred along the coastline from Cape Canaveral northward. The highest sustained wind recorded at the Melbourne International Airport was 53 mph from the north at 0146LST on October 7 and the peak gust was 70 mph from the northwest at 0257LST. A USAF wind sensor at 54 feet above ground level near the beach north of Cape Canaveral recorded a sustained wind of 79 mph and a gust of 107 mph. Other recorded peak wind gusts included 87 mph at Satellite Beach, 81 mph on Merritt Island and 77 mph at Cocoa Beach. Wind damage occurred to several hundred homes, often a result of impacts due to falling trees.  Eleven homes were destroyed, 140 sustained major damage, 549 experienced minor damage and an additional 1,500 homes were affected in some way. Structural damage to homes and businesses due to wind were confined mainly to the barrier islands as well as those properties exposed to larger bodies of water. Damage generally involved roof shingles, soffits, awnings, and pool enclosures. Further inland, property damage was mainly a result of fallen trees, especially to older buildings and mobile homes near wooded areas. Several homes experienced water intrusion due to damaged roofs. Two homes were lost to fire as officials suspended emergency services during the height of the storm. County-wide, there was sporadic damage to fences, awnings, and screen rooms. About 227,000 customers were without power at the height of the storm, or about 75 percent of the county. Preliminary property damage was estimated at $35 million to residential structures and $40 million to public structures. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for residents of the barrier islands, including Merritt Island, as well as low-lying areas, RV parks, and mobile homes across the remainder of the county. A total of 4,320 residents evacuated to shelters within the county.  There was one direct injury.

Over 180 residences were destroyed with about 4000 residences either damaged or destroyed.  The highest wind speed recorded was 91 kts (105 mph) in Jensen Beach.  No pressure data was recorded for Martin County. Severe beach erosion occurred compounding the damage from Hurricane Frances just 3 weeks earlier.",No entry,12041,29.73,-82.8

Daytona Beach reported a wind gust to 72 knots (83 mph) and Ormond Beach reported wind gusts of 76 knots (88 mph).  Like the counties to the south, Volusia County experienced widespread power outages, thousands of trees down, and damage to roofs, mobile homes, porches, awnings and car ports.  The Ormond Beach area was hit especially hard with east winds off the Atlantic as the hurricane center moved off the coast just to the south near Daytona Beach. Hundreds of trees were blown down and roofs were severely damaged on three beachfront hotels. Because the duration of the onshore wind was so brief, there was negligible storm surge. Minor roadway flooding occurred from the two to four inches of rain that fell.  A strong F1 touched down in South Daytona Beach with the primary rainband ahead of the hurricane. This tornado destroyed a home and severly damaged three others, mainly from fallen trees.  The roof was blown off a strip mall store and a fire was started at a service station when the tornado destroyed the gas pumps and blew down the service island canopy.  A smaller F0 tornado also came ashore on the barrier island injuring an elderly woman and damaging the roof of her house.  Two fatalities were attributed to Hurricane Charley. A man was killed during the cleanup when he was crushed by a large tree limb. A woman was killed when she walked into a submerged power line. Total estimated damage in the county was $52 million.",No entry,12041,29.73,-82.8

The hurricane continued northwest and was centered approximately 55 miles east of Stuart at 2300LST. Matthew then paralleled the Florida coast, remaining just offshore as a Category 3 hurricane. The eye reached its closest point of approach to land, only 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral near 0800LST on October 7, and was 35 miles east of Daytona Beach around 1100LST, as it continued moving northwest, just offshore the northeast Florida coast. Hurricane force winds (sustained or frequent gusts) affected coastal areas from Vero Beach northward, extending inland across the mainland portions of Brevard and Volusia Counties, with tropical storm force winds experienced across much of the remainder of east-central Florida. The strongest winds occurred along the coast from Cape Canaveral in Brevard County to north or Ormond-By-The-Sea in Volusia County, where Category 1-2 winds were likely experienced. Two direct hurricane-related fatalities and one direct injury occurred, in addition to nine indirect deaths. Preliminary damage estimates across east-central Florida exceeded $580 million, with $514 million reported in Volusia County alone.||A storm surge of 3-6 feet affected the beaches from near the Indian River/St. Lucie County line northward to the Volusia/Flagler County line, along with moderate to major beach erosion, with the highest surge (5-6 feet) and most significant erosion occurring north of Daytona Beach. Farther south, a surge of 2-3 feet occurred, along with minor to moderate beach erosion.  ||Rainfall totals reached 7-9 inches across parts of Seminole and Volusia Counties, where widespread flooding of streets and low-lying areas occurred. Elsewhere, rainfall totals were generally 2-6 inches, with isolated, minor flooding of poor drainage areas and standing water on roadways.","The center of major Hurricane Matthew passed only 30 miles offshore Volusia County during the morning hours of October 7, producing a 12-hour period of sustained tropical storm force winds through much of the county and a shorter period of frequent gusts to hurricane force closer to the coast. A NWS damage survey confirmed that sustained category 1 hurricane winds likely occurred along portions of the coastline. The highest sustained wind recorded at the Daytona Beach International Airport was 52 mph from the north at 0545LST on October 7 and the peak gust was 71 mph from the north at 0711LST. Other recorded peak wind gusts included 84 mph at Embry-Riddle University in Daytona Beach and 83 mph at New Smyrna Beach. Wind damage occurred to several thousand homes, often a result of impacts due to falling trees.  Sixty-nine homes were destroyed, 467 sustained major damage, 1,494 experienced minor damage and an additional 10,041 homes were affected in some way. Structural damage to homes and businesses due to wind were mainly confined to the barrier islands as well as those properties exposed to larger bodies of water. Damage to the roofs of older buildings was more notable than newer construction, where damage was generally confined to roof shingles, soffits, awnings, and pool enclosures. Further inland, property damage was mainly a result of fallen trees, especially to older buildings and mobile homes within densely wooded areas.  At the peak of the storm, nearly 258,000 customers were without power, or 92% of the county.  Preliminary property damage was estimated at $514.4 million. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for all of the barrier islands, as well as low-lying areas, RV parks, and mobile homes across the remainder of the county. A total of 4,000 residents evacuated to shelters within the county.  One direct fatality and four indirect fatalities resulted from the hurricane. A 63-year-old woman died on October 7 during the hurricane when a tree fell on her as she was feeding animals outside her Deland home. On October 10, an 87-year-old man was electrocuted by a downed power line in Deleon Springs around 0700LST. Also on this date, a 9-year-old Daytona Beach boy was found unconscious in his home after officials discovered a generator running in another room. The boy later died from carbon monoxide poisoning at a local medical center. A 47-year-old Ohio man assisting with debris cleanup efforts in Ormond Beach was killed on October 10 when part of a downed tree rolled on top of him and pinned him underneath. On October 14 around 1000LST, a 52-year old tree trimmer died after he was electrocuted while cleaning up storm debris in a Deltona backyard.",12041,29.73,-82.8

The hurricane warning was dropped at 900 AM CST on September 16 and we were put under a tropical storm warning.  The tropical storm warning was dropped at 300 PM CST on September 16.  Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 51 knots from the north with a peak gust of 65 knots from the north northeast.

Eglin Air Force Base (VPS) 7.43 inches. 10 S Mossy Head 8.92 inches.Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",No entry,1051,32.596944444444,-86.151388888889

Major Hurricane Katrina impacted portions of the area during the day of August 29th.    The storm made landfall over southeast Louisiana around sunrise on August 29.  The center of Katrina tracked north northeast near I-59 across southeast Mississippi.  Katrina had a large eye and the wind field was also very large.  Gusts to hurricane force were felt as far east as the Alabama and Mississippi state line. Wind damage from Katrina decreased as you got farther east of the center of the storm.  However, high storm surge values were observed as far east as Destin in Okaloosa county.  The storm surge with Katrina was one of the highest ever recorded as far east as Mobile Bay.  Coastal counties in Alabama were put under a Hurricane Watch  at 300 PM CST on August 27, then a Hurricane Warning at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The coastal counties in northwest Florida were put under a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The Hurricane Watch was dropped for the coastal counties in northwest Florida at 900 AM CST on August 29.  The Tropical Storm Warning for northwest Florida was dropped at 300 PM CST on August 29.  The Hurricane Warning for coastal Alabama was changed to a Tropical Storm Warning at 300 PM CST on August 29.  All tropical warnings were dropped for the entire area at 900 PM CST on August 29 as Katrina moved rapidly inland.  An inland Hurricane Warning was issued for southeast Mississippi and parts of southwest Alabama on August 27 and August 28.  All inland tropical warnings were dropped the evening of August 29.Some of the wind reports from across southwest Alabama on August 29 were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 57 knots with a peak gust of 72 knots.  Brookley Field, sustained wind of 58 knots with a peak gust of 73 knots.  Evergreen, sustained wind of 32 knots with a peak gust of 42 knots.

Some other estimated values: Bayou La Batre with 11-14 feet.  Dog River area 10-13 feet.  Baldwin county with 9-11 feet.  Escambia county with 7-9 feet.  Santa rosa with 5-8 feet.  Okaloosa county with 4-6 feet.  The surge values in Mobile Bay were among the highest ever recorded for the area.  Over 20 million dollars in damage was done to the Alabama State Docks due to the high surge.Major beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to east of Destin.  The west end of Dauphin Island was completely under water with most of the homes on the west end washed away.  Flash flooding occurred throughout the day as Katrina moved inland.  High winds from Katrina caused significant tree and power line damage to the counties that border the Mississippi and Alabama state line.  Stone and Perry counties in Mississippi received the most damage.  The damage in those two counties resembled the inland damage that hurricane Ivan produced in Alabama last year. Highway 98 in Okaloosa county again had some of the lanes damage due to surge.  I-10 bridge across Pensacola Bay was closed for several hours due to high winds.  The Wallace Tunnel was closed due to high water from the surge.  Most of the businesses on the Causeway over Mobile Bay were damaged or destroyed by the high water.  An oil rig being worked on broke free and floated up Mobile Bay and became lodged underneath the Cochran-Africatown Bridge.  The bridge had to be closed for several hours until it could be inspected for damage.  Several weak tornadoes occurred across the area.No direct deaths were reported with Katrina in southeast Mississippi, southwest Alabama and northwest Florida.",No entry,1051,32.596944444444,-86.151388888889

The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",No entry,1053,31.126666666667,-87.162222222222

Rainfall totals ranged from 9.26 inches at Mossy Head, FL, to 0.15 inches at Cross City, FL.  Storm tides along the Gulf coast varied from ten feet in Bay and Walton counties to four feet in Taylor and Dixie counties.  Large swells from Ivan began to the affect the Gulf coast from the St. Joseph Peninsula to the Suwannee River on September 14.  Storm surges continued for several hours after landfall.  Beach erosion varied from extreme (20 to 40 feet) in Walton County to minor at St. George Island.  Minor areal flooding affected much of the Florida Panhandle, including Walton, Bay, Holmes, Calhoun, Jackson and Gulf counties.  Sharp rises to near or slightly above minor flood levels occurred on the Choctawhatchee River at Caryville, the Apalachicola River at Blountstown, and the Shoal River at Mossy Head.  An estimated 165,000 customers were without power.  There were widespread reports of downed trees and power lines.  The hardest hit areas were Gulf, Bay, and Walton counties, where more than 50 percent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Numerous roads in the Panhandle coastal counties were flooded or washed out.  Intense outer rain bands from Ivan spawned numerous tornadoes over portions of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.  The hardest hit counties were Bay, Calhoun, and Jackson counties, which accounted for six deaths and 16 injuries.  Mandatory evacuations of low lying, coastal, and mobile home residents was ordered by officials in Bay, Walton, Jackson, Holmes, Jackson, Franklin, and Taylor counties.

Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 4 inches in the eastern Florida Panhandle to 6 to 10 inches in the Florida Big Bend.  Flooding was reported in southern Leon County where several areas were under 3 to 4 feet of water.  Maximum coastal storm surge heights ranged from 4 to 8 feet in Walton, Bay, Gulf, Taylor and Dixie counties to 8 to 12 feet in Franklin, Wakulla and Jefferson counties.  Moderate to severe beach erosion was observed along the beaches of Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla counties.  Across coastal Walton County, all public dunes and walkovers were damaged.  At St George Island, five miles of road and numerous structures were damaged or destroyed by Dennis' storm surge.  Dennis' deluge caused several rivers and creeks in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend to exceed their flood stages, including the Ocklockonee, Aucilla, St Marks rivers, and Spring Creek.  An interesting aspect to the flooding is the remarkable surge up to 8 feet that propagated up the rivers.  This surge was evident from the mouth of the Suwannee River to as far west as the Choctawhatchee River.  The worst property damage occurred along the coast from Walton to Wakulla County, where more than a 1,000 homes and businesses were affected.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,12013,30.41,-85.2

Rainfall totals ranged from 9.26 inches at Mossy Head, FL, to 0.15 inches at Cross City, FL.  Storm tides along the Gulf coast varied from ten feet in Bay and Walton counties to four feet in Taylor and Dixie counties.  Large swells from Ivan began to the affect the Gulf coast from the St. Joseph Peninsula to the Suwannee River on September 14.  Storm surges continued for several hours after landfall.  Beach erosion varied from extreme (20 to 40 feet) in Walton County to minor at St. George Island.  Minor areal flooding affected much of the Florida Panhandle, including Walton, Bay, Holmes, Calhoun, Jackson and Gulf counties.  Sharp rises to near or slightly above minor flood levels occurred on the Choctawhatchee River at Caryville, the Apalachicola River at Blountstown, and the Shoal River at Mossy Head.  An estimated 165,000 customers were without power.  There were widespread reports of downed trees and power lines.  The hardest hit areas were Gulf, Bay, and Walton counties, where more than 50 percent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Numerous roads in the Panhandle coastal counties were flooded or washed out.  Intense outer rain bands from Ivan spawned numerous tornadoes over portions of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.  The hardest hit counties were Bay, Calhoun, and Jackson counties, which accounted for six deaths and 16 injuries.  Mandatory evacuations of low lying, coastal, and mobile home residents was ordered by officials in Bay, Walton, Jackson, Holmes, Jackson, Franklin, and Taylor counties.

The peak wind gust and lowest sea-level pressure recorded were 67 knots and 979 mb, respectively, at Buoy 42039 located 80 miles south of Panama City, FL.  Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 4 inches in the eastern Florida Panhandle to 6 to 10 inches in the Florida Big Bend.  Flooding was reported in southern Leon County where several areas were under 3 to 4 feet of water.  Maximum coastal storm surge heights ranged from 4 to 8 feet in Walton, Bay, Gulf, Taylor and Dixie counties to 8 to 12 feet in Franklin, Wakulla and Jefferson counties.  Moderate to severe beach erosion was observed along the beaches of Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla counties.  Across coastal Walton County, all public dunes and walkovers were damaged.  At St George Island, five miles of road and numerous structures were damaged or destroyed by Dennis' storm surge.  Dennis' deluge caused several rivers and creeks in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend to exceed their flood stages, including the Ocklockonee, Aucilla, St Marks rivers, and Spring Creek.  An interesting aspect to the flooding is the remarkable surge up to 8 feet that propagated up the rivers.  This surge was evident from the mouth of the Suwannee River to as far west as the Choctawhatchee River.  The worst property damage occurred along the coast from Walton to Wakulla County, where more than a 1,000 homes and businesses were affected.  Also, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines across the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend, leaving about 75,000 customers without power.

Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 51 knots from the north with a peak gust of 65 knots from the north northeast.

The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",No entry,1059,34.433333333333,-87.85

Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",No entry,1055,34.05,-86.03333333333298

Rainfall totals ranged from 9.26 inches at Mossy Head, FL, to 0.15 inches at Cross City, FL.  Storm tides along the Gulf coast varied from ten feet in Bay and Walton counties to four feet in Taylor and Dixie counties.  Large swells from Ivan began to the affect the Gulf coast from the St. Joseph Peninsula to the Suwannee River on September 14.  Storm surges continued for several hours after landfall.  Beach erosion varied from extreme (20 to 40 feet) in Walton County to minor at St. George Island.  Minor areal flooding affected much of the Florida Panhandle, including Walton, Bay, Holmes, Calhoun, Jackson and Gulf counties.  Sharp rises to near or slightly above minor flood levels occurred on the Choctawhatchee River at Caryville, the Apalachicola River at Blountstown, and the Shoal River at Mossy Head.  An estimated 165,000 customers were without power.  There were widespread reports of downed trees and power lines.  The hardest hit areas were Gulf, Bay, and Walton counties, where more than 50 percent of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Numerous roads in the Panhandle coastal counties were flooded or washed out.  Intense outer rain bands from Ivan spawned numerous tornadoes over portions of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.  The hardest hit counties were Bay, Calhoun, and Jackson counties, which accounted for six deaths and 16 injuries.  Mandatory evacuations of low lying, coastal, and mobile home residents was ordered by officials in Bay, Walton, Jackson, Holmes, Jackson, Franklin, and Taylor counties.

Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 4 inches in the eastern Florida Panhandle to 6 to 10 inches in the Florida Big Bend.  Flooding was reported in southern Leon County where several areas were under 3 to 4 feet of water.  Maximum coastal storm surge heights ranged from 4 to 8 feet in Walton, Bay, Gulf, Taylor and Dixie counties to 8 to 12 feet in Franklin, Wakulla and Jefferson counties.  Moderate to severe beach erosion was observed along the beaches of Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin and Wakulla counties.  Across coastal Walton County, all public dunes and walkovers were damaged.  At St George Island, five miles of road and numerous structures were damaged or destroyed by Dennis' storm surge.  Dennis' deluge caused several rivers and creeks in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend to exceed their flood stages, including the Ocklockonee, Aucilla, St Marks rivers, and Spring Creek.  An interesting aspect to the flooding is the remarkable surge up to 8 feet that propagated up the rivers.  This surge was evident from the mouth of the Suwannee River to as far west as the Choctawhatchee River.  The worst property damage occurred along the coast from Walton to Wakulla County, where more than a 1,000 homes and businesses were affected.

The western side of Ivan effected a large portion of Eastern Mississippi as the center moved north through Alabama. Thousands of trees were blown down across Eastern Mississippi during the event as well as hundreds of power lines. The strong wind itself did not cause much structural damage, however the fallen trees did. These downed trees accounted for several hundred homes, mobile homes and businesses to be damaged or destroyed. Most locations across Eastern Mississippi reported sustained winds between 30 and 40 mph with Tropical Storm force gusts between 48 and 54 mph. The strongest reported winds occurred in Newton, Lauderdale and Oktibbeha counties. A Mississippi mesonet site, in Newton, reported maximum sustained winds of 42 mph and peak gust of 54 mph. At Key Field in Meridian, maximum sustained winds were reported at 43 mph with a peak gust of 61 mph. The highest sustained and peak wind occurred at the Mississippi State Climate Lab in Starkville. This site reported maximum sustained winds of 52 mph and a peak gust of 64 mph.Overall, rainfall totals were held in check as Ivan steadily moved north. The heaviest rains were confined to far Eastern Mississippi where 3 to 4 inches fell over a 15 hour period. Due to the duration of the rain no flooding was reported.Across Eastern Mississippi, Hurricane Ivan was responsible for one fatality. This fatality occurred in Brooksville when a tree fell on a man.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28073,31.21,-89.51

Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County. About $255 million came from the agricultural community in Miami-Dade County.||Total number of people who were at county evacuation shelters were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 31,092, Palm Beach County - 17,263, Collier County - 17,040, Broward County - 17,000, Hendry County - 3,000||Total number of customers without power were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 888,530, Broward County - 689,000, Palm Beach County- 566,240, Collier County -  197,630, Hendry County - 9,700, Glades County - 1,670.","Hurricane Irma produced maximum sustained winds of 60 to 75 mph across inland sections of Miami-Dade County, with a maximum sustained wind reading of 76 mph five miles southwest of Florida City. Wind gusts to hurricane force were observed across the entire area, with highest gust of 90 mph measured at Chekika in the Everglades. There was widespread damage to trees, fences and power poles, with limited damage to structures. Information on death toll, damage estimates, customers without power and people in evacuation shelters is contained in the event summary for Metropolitan Miami-Dade County.",12073,30.46,-84.28

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.

A nearly stationary feeder band from the eastern Florida Panhandle into southwest Georgia produced four to eight inches, with isolated amounts up to a foot.  In Colquitt County, flash flooding along the Okapilco Creek in Moultrie damaged many homes, washed out roads, and forced the evacuation of 100 homes.  Heavy rains in the upper Flint River basin generated high flows which reached as far south as Bainbridge, GA.  Minor flooding occurred along the Flint and Withlacoochee River basins with a few homes affected by high water.  Several counties in southwest Georgia observed wind damage to trees and power lines.  In Worth County, a total of 300 homes were evacuated due to rising flood water, with 80 homes flooded.  In Dougherty County, dozens of homes and businesses in Putney lost power.  Also, flooding was confined to both sides of Highway 82 near the Worth County line.  About 5,000 Albany customers were without power.  At Mitchell County Middle School, strong winds caused roof damage.  Several homes were flooded in Calhoun County.  Several Decatur County roads were washed out.  In Terrell County, many roads were flooded.  Fishpond Drain in Seminole County flashed with several homes surrounded by rising flood water.  A pond dam burst and caused a torrent of water to overrun a road in Tift County.  6,000 customers were without power in Decatur, Grady, and Thomas counties.  A large portion of eastern Thomas County observed between 6 and 11 inches of rain.  A few Boston homes were evacuated and many county roads were washed out.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28029,31.86,-90.44

Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.

By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.

Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.

Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.

The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.

Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",No entry,13045,33.58,-85.08

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.  Gusty west winds developed on August 30th as Katrina was dissipating over the Tennessee and Ohio Valley.  However, wind gusts were mostly in the 20-30 mph range, which resulted in just isolated incidents of downed trees and power lines throughout the day across north and west Georgia.",No entry,13045,33.58,-85.08

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.  According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.  The estimated damages were as follows:  Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million.  ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,13155,31.6,-83.27

Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.

Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",No entry,13007,31.33,-84.45

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.  Gusty west winds developed on August 30th as Katrina was dissipating over the Tennessee and Ohio Valley.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.

The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",No entry,13125,33.23,-82.61

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28049,32.26,-90.44

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28049,32.26,-90.44

The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28055,32.74,-90.99

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28055,32.74,-90.99

The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28059,30.46,-88.62

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28059,30.46,-88.62

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28053,33.13,-90.52

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28053,33.13,-90.52

The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.

The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.

The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.",No entry,28019,33.35,-89.25

The outer bands of Rita affected portions of Southwest Mississippi, all of Northeast Louisiana and a portion of Southern Arkansas early Saturday into Sunday. The major impacts from this hurricane were the large severe weather/tornado outbreak, heavy rainfall and lastly, tropical storm force winds and gusts across the west and southwest portion of the area.The severe weather outbreak, spawned from the outer edges of Rita, lasted about 36 hours from Saturday into Sunday evening. Officially, 55 tornadoes occurred across the Jackson, Ms, National Weather Service (NWS), county warning area (CWA). This makes the tornado outbreak during Rita the largest tornado outbreak in  the NWS Jackson CWA in recorded history. Of the 55 total tornadoes, 1 was rated an F3 and 7 were rated F2. Additionally, 1 fatality occurred in Humphreys county and there were a total of 16 injuries. As a final note, tornado outbreaks are not uncommon during landfalling tropical cyclones. In fact, Hurricane Andrew produced 26 tornadoes across Mississippi in late August 1992. As you can see, the tornadoes during Rita (55) far surpass what occurred with Andrew (26).Heavy rain became a problem as a large area across Western Mississippi, Northeast Louisiana and Southeast Arkansas received 4 to 7 inches of rain. A smaller corridor of the region, generally along the Big Black River, received 7 to 10 inches early Sunday morning. This heavy rain caused areas of flooding for many locations with the worst flooding occurring in an area close to the Big Black River. The most significant flooding occurred in Warren and Yazoo counties were many homes were flooded as well several as roads washed out. Additionally, this heavy rain fell at a vulnerable time for many crops across the region. The main impact was to the cotton crop as many plants had the cotton open then became wet as the heavy rains fell.Lastly, tropical storm force winds extended out far enough from Rita to give a portion of the region sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph with wind gusts as high as 40 to 50 mph. These gradient winds from Rita were mainly confined to areas west of Interstate 55 from Grenada to Jackson, and then south-eastward from Jackson to Columbia. These winds were responsible for downing many trees and power lines across the western portion of the Jackson CWA, as well as having some trees fall on homes.",No entry,28019,33.35,-89.25

An estimated 90 to 95 percent of the homes in the parish were severely damaged or destroyed - over 5000 residences. Storm surge values are estimated around 15 feet in parts of Cameron Parish. The storm surge also moved up the Calcasieu ship channel, flooding portions of Calcasieu Parish, including sections of downtown Lake Charles near the civic center, where the storm surge was estimated between 6 and 8 feet. Storm surge also was a significant problem in Vermilion Parish, which saw locations 10 ft above sea level flooded - including all of Pecan Island, Intracoastal City, and Delcambre.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage across coastal Mississippi was catastrophic.  The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate 10.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, signage,  downed tress, and some windows were broken by wind and wind driven debris In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines.  Damage was less extensive in southwest Mississippi.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Mississippi were estimated at 9.8 billion dollars. Uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars across the Gulf Coast.As of late October the following fatality figures were reported in the Mississippi coastal counties; Hancock- 52, Harrison - 83, Jackson - 17. Additional details on fatalities will be given in later updates to storm data.Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  The lowest pressure on the Mississippi coast was estimated to be 928 mb where the hurricane made landfall near the Louisiana Mississippi border. A pressure of 976 mb was recorded at 0951 CDT by a university weather station deployed in Pascagoula, well east of the landfall location.  At approximately the same time, the pressure at the NWS office in Slidell, just to the west of landfall location, recorded a pressure of 934.1 mb at 0938 AM CDT. The highest wind gusts recorded in Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters were 117 knots (134 mph) at the Pearl River County EOC office in Poplarville and 102 knots (118 mph) at 1000AM CDT by a university wind tower deployed at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County.  Maximum sustained winds in Mississippi were estimated around 105 knots (121 mph) near the storm's second landfall along the Mississippi and Louisiana border.  Unofficial wind observations before the gage failed included a wind gust of 106 kt, (122 mph) at 0615 CDT by an amateur radio operator in Long Beach and a wind gust of 108 kt (124 mph) at the EOC in Pascagoula. Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 10 to 16 inches across coastal and south Mississippi with much lower amounts observed over southwest Mississippi.

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.  Gusty west winds developed on August 30th as Katrina was dissipating over the Tennessee and Ohio Valley.

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage across coastal Mississippi was catastrophic.  The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate 10.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, signage,  downed tress, and some windows were broken by wind and wind driven debris In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines.  Damage was less extensive in southwest Mississippi.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Mississippi were estimated at 9.8 billion dollars. Uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars across the Gulf Coast.As of late October the following fatality figures were reported in the Mississippi coastal counties; Hancock- 52, Harrison - 83, Jackson - 17. Additional details on fatalities will be given in later updates to storm data.Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  The lowest pressure on the Mississippi coast was estimated to be 928 mb where the hurricane made landfall near the Louisiana Mississippi border. A pressure of 976 mb was recorded at 0951 CDT by a university weather station deployed in Pascagoula, well east of the landfall location.  At approximately the same time, the pressure at the NWS office in Slidell, just to the west of landfall location, recorded a pressure of 934.1 mb at 0938 AM CDT. The highest wind gusts recorded in Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters were 117 knots (134 mph) at the Pearl River County EOC office in Poplarville and 102 knots (118 mph) at 1000AM CDT by a university wind tower deployed at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County.  Maximum sustained winds in Mississippi were estimated around 105 knots (121 mph) near the storm's second landfall along the Mississippi and Louisiana border.  Unofficial wind observations before the gage failed included a wind gust of 106 kt, (122 mph) at 0615 CDT by an amateur radio operator in Long Beach and a wind gust of 108 kt (124 mph) at the EOC in Pascagoula. Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 10 to 16 inches across coastal and south Mississippi with much lower amounts observed over southwest Mississippi.

The hurricane, which rapidly strenghted from a tropical storm off the upper Texas coast late on the 12th, moved inland near the Texas-Louisiana border early on the 13th.  The remnants of Hurricane Humberto then tracked across central Louisiana, central Mississippi, and into northern Alabama on the 14th.  The center of the remnant of the track moved across extreme northwest Georgia, Dade and Walker county, on the 14th.  With north Georgia being located within the favorable right quadrant of the track, much needed rainfall fell across north central and northwest parts of the state, mainly northwest of a Rome to Gainesville line.  Rainfall amounts of two to three inches were common within this area, with isolated five to six  inch rainfall amounts in parts of Whitfield and Murray counties.  Further south, rainfall amounts were generally one inch or less.  However, afternoon heating combined with the final feeder band associated with Humberto to bring a line of heavy showers and thunderstorms to north Georgia during the afternoon.  A few trees were blown down and there were a couple of reports of hail.  However, no significant damage was reported within Georgia as a result of the remnants of Humberto.",13023,32.44,-83.33

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",No entry,13061,31.62,-84.99

While this storm will be most remembered for the extensive devastation that was done to southeast Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, and eastward along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Katrina was a very large and powerful storm with far reaching effects to the east.  By mid-afternoon on August 29th, strong spiral bands of showers and thunderstorms made their way into west Georgia.  These spiral bands gradually propagated eastward through the state during the evening and overnight hours.  Between 4 pm EDT and 1 am EDT, a total of 16 confirmed tornadoes touched down in north and central Georgia.  The first tornado struck northern Heard county at 424 pm EDT, while the last tornado struck the town of Helen in the northeast Georgia mountains shortly after midnight at 1230 am EDT.  All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.  Gusty west winds developed on August 30th as Katrina was dissipating over the Tennessee and Ohio Valley.  However, wind gusts were mostly in the 20-30 mph range, which resulted in just isolated incidents of downed trees and power lines throughout the day across north and west Georgia.",No entry,13061,31.62,-84.99

Rita was a Category 3 hurricane at landfall.Two and a half weeks after Hurricane Katrina made her final and devastating landfall along the northern Gulf coast, all eyes turned to Tropical Storm Rita as she moved westward through the central Bahamas. On Tuesday, September 20th, Rita rapidly intensified while moving west through the Florida Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita reached Category 2 intensity as the center passed about 50 miles south of Key West and significantly impacted the Florida Keys. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Rita intensified at an astounding rate going from Category 2 to Category 5 intensity in 24 hours. Following this rapid intensification period, sustained winds reached 165 mph on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 21st. Since early Monday, Rita had been consistently forecast to make landfall along the upper southeast Texas coast, when the 120 hour forecast from the National Hurricane Center depicted a landfall near San Luis Pass. Emergency management officials, members of the media, and residents of southeast Texas had been watching Rita closely and planning their course of action on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day.The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas. Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger.Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed.Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain.All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way. In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly. In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County.

Rita was a Category 3 hurricane at landfall.Two and a half weeks after Hurricane Katrina made her final and devastating landfall along the northern Gulf coast, all eyes turned to Tropical Storm Rita as she moved westward through the central Bahamas. On Tuesday, September 20th, Rita rapidly intensified while moving west through the Florida Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita reached Category 2 intensity as the center passed about 50 miles south of Key West and significantly impacted the Florida Keys. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Rita intensified at an astounding rate going from Category 2 to Category 5 intensity in 24 hours. Following this rapid intensification period, sustained winds reached 165 mph on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 21st. Since early Monday, Rita had been consistently forecast to make landfall along the upper southeast Texas coast, when the 120 hour forecast from the National Hurricane Center depicted a landfall near San Luis Pass. Emergency management officials, members of the media, and residents of southeast Texas had been watching Rita closely and planning their course of action on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day.The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas. Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger.Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed.Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain.All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way. In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly. In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days. Minor damage was reported in Surfside to roads and a few homes. Total damage was around $500,000.In Montgomery County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed.

Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day.The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas. Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger.Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed.Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain.All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way. In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly. In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days. Minor damage was reported in Surfside to roads and a few homes. Total damage was around $500,000.In Montgomery County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $2.5 million. There were 13 indirect fatalities. Ten of the deaths were evacuation related while 3 deaths were carbon monoxide poisoning with no electricity in the home.In Walker County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $1.5 million.   In Galveston County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts to hurricane force were reported across the county, especially on the Bolivar Peninsula. Numerous power poles and road signs were blown down on Bolivar. Many of the beach homes received roof damage. Numerous trees were down with small structure damage on High Island. Power was out to most of the county on Saturday. In Galveston's historic district, a large brick-covered side of a three-story building collapsed and three other buildings caught fire and were destroyed during the height of the storm. There were three directly related injuries. A thirty-year-old woman suffered severe burns in the fire and two firefighters had minor injuries. Small structure, dock, and pier damage along with downed power lines occurred across Galveston Island. Total damage across the county was around $15 million.In Chambers County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. One frame building near Winnie received major damage. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $8 million. One indirect fatality occurred in the county.In Liberty County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $7 million. There were two direct fatalities. In Hardin, a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on the home they were sleeping in. In Polk and San Jacinto Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Widespread trees were down with many trees taking down power lines. Some trees fell onto homes and caused considerable damage. Widespread power outages were observed across both counties. Lake Livingston Dam reported a wind gust of 117 mph around 5:30 AM Saturday morning. This wind sensor was on the dam and the wind was blowing across the lake. With the reduced friction across the lake's surface, this wind gust report is reasonable. The strong wind blowing along the lake created a storm surge of approximately 1.5 feet at the dam. This high water and the wave action damaged the dam which required emergency releases from the lake to stabilize the dam. The damage in Polk County was around $23 million with $20 million of that being damage to the dam at Lake Livingston. Damage in San Jacinto County was estimated at $10 million. There was one direct fatality in San Jacinto County. A three-year-old female was killed instantly by a tree falling on to her home in Point Blank. In Houston and Trinity Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near 50 mph were observed. Numerous trees were down resulting in numerous power outages. One heat related indirect death occurred in Houston County during the evacuation. Total damage for both Houston and Trinity counties was near $2 million.No tornadoes were reported with Rita. Maximum rainfall amounts with Rita were between 4 and 6 inches in and around the New Caney area of Montgomery County.",No entry,48177,29.45,-97.49

The storm made good progress northward during the day of September 13th and brought Tropical Storm force winds to much of northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana and extreme southwest Arkansas. The storm produced widespread downed trees and power lines along with structural damage either from the winds or from downed trees which fell on top of structures.  Power outages were widespread across a three state area of northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana and southwest Arkansas.  Southwest Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) which provides electricity to a good portion of northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana and southwest Arkansas said that the number of outages peaked at 187,000 customers.  Additional power companies were called in from far away as Indiana and Michigan to deal with the numerous power outages. This was the second most number of outages at one time reported in SWEPCO's 96 year history.  The most number of outages was 234,000 during the ice storm of December 13th, 2000.  The number of power outages in association with Hurricane Ike topped the September 2005 recovery from Hurricane Rita by nearly 1000 customers.  The storm also produced tornadoes across portions of north central Louisiana as well as south central Arkansas and east central Texas.","Hurricane force winds resulted in widespread trees and power lines downed throughout the county.  Power outages were widespread as well with numerous residents without power during the height of the storm and well after the storm.

Dolly intensified rapidly to an estimated minimum pressure of 962 mb while drifting northward just east of South Padre Island, and its center made landfall between 1 and 2 PM on July 23rd along the unpopulated shoreline of Cameron and Willacy County. Dolly then eased westward across southern Willacy County through the afternoon, continued into extreme northern Hidalgo County as a tropical storm during the evening, then turned northwest and accelerated through Jim Hogg County during the early morning hours of the 24th, passing into Webb County shortly after sunrise.||The strong winds and heavy rains contributed to widespread power outages in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, where at least 236,000 customers lost power, but possibly upwards of 250,000 - primarily across the more populated regions of Cameron, Hidalgo, and Willacy County. Agricultural experts deemed a substantial loss of cotton and sorghum due to the strong winds and torrential rain. As of the end of Calendar Year 2008, estimated insured property damage (wind) based on the standard doubling of insurance estimates from the Property Claims Service of the Insurance Services Office was $1.05 billion.  Reported insured flood damage from FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is $171 thousand; however, it is estimated that the vast majority of flood damage occurred to uninsured properties, and a rough estimate of total flood damage, which was more widespread, and includes agricultural losses, will likely push total flood-related damages to between $100 and $300 million.  ||It is conceivable that total damage from all Hurricane Dolly related hazards may have exceeded $1.5 billion.||More than 6,000 Lower Rio Grande Valley residents were housed in temporary shelters from Deep South Texas to San Antonio at the peak of the storm; 13,000 residents across the Lower Rio Grande Valley visited FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers after the storm.  As of October 3rd, FEMA had distributed $44 million in relief; $30 million to individual households, nearly $10 million to small businesses through the Small Business Administration, and just under $5 million to local governments for infrastructure repair.||Please note that best estimates will be included on a county by county basis as data is received through the rest of the year.  ||Storm total rainfall from the evening of July 22nd through the early afternoon of July 24th generally ranged from 4 to 10 inches in Kenedy, Brooks, Starr, Jim Hogg, and Zapata Counties, and 6 to 14 inches in  Hidalgo, Willacy, and Cameron Counties, with locally more than 18 inches possible in the persistent southern eyewall in northern Cameron and southern Willacy Counties.  Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in these areas as Dolly moved through, and low lying, poor drainage, or areas where drainage systems failed were flooded for days, and in some cases weeks, to come.||The late intensification of Dolly just prior to landfall, combined with a brief northward jog before turning to the west along the Cameron/Willacy County line, limited Gulf storm surge effects across the Town of South Padre Island through mid morning on the 23rd.  However, hurricane force west winds whipped an estimated 3 to 4 foot water rise from Laguna Madre across the Town, with water briefly stretching across the Island at the height of the event.  The town of Port Mansfield, immediately north of the center, estimated a 4 foot storm surge and 5 foot storm tide. ||Interestingly, tides to the north of Dolly's center initially fell to below predicted values on increasing northerly winds, before rising during the late afternoon and evening as the cyclone moved inland, and strong southerly flow piled a storm tide of up to 6 feet above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) along the uninhabited Kenedy County shoreline.||There was a single confirmed tornado in Cameron County during the late evening of July 22nd, associated with one of the first outer rain bands.  No damage was reported.","After edging northward just off the Cameron County coastline during the early to mid morning, the inner western eyewall reached South Padre Island at around 11 AM CDT, further intensifying between 11 AM and 1 PM while edging across Laguna Madre into Port Isabel, Bayview, Laguna Heights, and Laguna Vista.  Sustained winds at 7.2 feet above ground level in completely exposed areas peaked at 78 mph at 1:20 PM CDT on South Padre Island, measured by a sensor just north of the northernmost beach access point. ||As the western eyewall continued to intensify and begin moving inland, it is assumed that at similarly exposed locations near the coast, periods of sustained one minute winds just above hurricane force (74 mph) were experienced. Peak sustained winds at higher exposed locations, such as near the top of high rise buildings in the Town of South Padre Island, may have occasionally reached or exceeded 100 mph between noon and 130 PM.   ||The most significant damage was seen in locations with a pronounced exposure to the west or southwest, from which the strongest winds in the inner eyewall occurred.  In these areas, structures with open, gable-ended aluminum or metal roofs had all or portions of the roofs torn off.  Stucco cladding at the Town of South Padre Island's Convention Center was shorn from one wall.  Similar damage was noted from Port Isabel through Bayview, including to hangars and the tower cab at the Cameron County airport.  A number of resorts on South Padre Island sustained damage, particularly in older high rises where the combination of roof, siding, and window damage resulted in weeks to months of repair.  Other common damage included hundreds of felled wooden telephone poles, as well as quite a bit of shingle damage to better constructed homes.  Hundreds of large tree limbs were also blown down.  Power outages were widespread and of long duration, generally from one to two weeks in most locations.  ||There were two notable injuries on South Padre Island. A 17 year old boy was blown from a 7th floor balcony at a high rise condominium; a woman was injured at the Bahia Mar resort when part of a stairwell collapsed on her.",48257,32.6,-96.28

At landfall, Ike had a central pressure of 951.6 mb, as measured at Galveston Pleasure Pier, and a maximum estimated storm surge of 17 feet over portions of Chambers County and the Bolivar Peninsula. Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County. The majority of property damage at the coast was a result of storm tide. ||Collectively, damage amounts are estimated to be near 14 billion dollars over the counties of Harris, Chambers, Galveston, Liberty, Polk, Matagorda, Brazoria, Fort Bend, San Jacinto, and Montgomery with an estimated 8 billion of that due to storm surge in coastal Galveston, Harris and Chambers Counties. Fresh water flooding also occurred near the city of Houston where up to 14 inches of rain fell over a two day period, first from Ike, then from a line of thunderstorms associated with a cold front moving through the following day. The number of fatalities directly related to Ike was 12 in the aforementioned counties with 11 of those occurring in Galveston County from drowning due to the storm surge. In addition, there were at least 25 fatalities indirectly related to Ike, either due to carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, accidents while clearing debris, or house fires from candles. There were no known tornadoes associated with Ike.",Pockets of damage with eastern part of county hardest hit. An estimated 200 roofs sustained damage.

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",No entry,22071,29.96666667,-90.05

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.

Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively. Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th. Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.","A Hurricane Matthew NWS survey of Tybee Island revealed damage to a roof of a home on 19th street near the southern end of the beach that was consistent with 96 mph wind gusts measured at a nearby sensor the morning of October 8th. Wind damaged siding and the roof of a building closest to the ocean on Center Street. Numerous trees were blown down across interior sections of Tybee Island, including several large trees on homes along U.S. Highway 80. On the southern tip of Wilmington Island, hundreds of large oaks and pines were broken and uprooted. Several trees damaged homes.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively. Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th.

The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County. About $255 million came from the agricultural community in Miami-Dade County.||Total number of people who were at county evacuation shelters were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 31,092, Palm Beach County - 17,263, Collier County - 17,040, Broward County - 17,000, Hendry County - 3,000||Total number of customers without power were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 888,530, Broward County - 689,000, Palm Beach County- 566,240, Collier County -  197,630, Hendry County - 9,700, Glades County - 1,670.",Satellite imagery and radar velocity data support wind speeds of 75 to 90 mph were sustained in Mainland Monroe county.

Dorian formed on August 24, 2019 from a tropical wave in the Central Atlantic and gradually strengthened as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles, becoming a hurricane on August 28. Rapid intensification occurred, and on August 31, Dorian became a Category 4 hurricane. On September 1, Dorian reached Category 5 intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, and a minimum central pressure of 910 mb  (26.87 inHg) while making landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas. Dorian made another landfall on Grand Bahama several hours later. The ridge of high pressure steering Dorian westward collapsed on September 2, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama for about a day. It is the strongest known tropical system to impact the Bahamas. A combination of cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle weakened Dorian to a Category 2 hurricane on the next day. On the morning of September 3, Dorian began to move slowly towards the north-northwest. Dorian subsequently completed its eyewall replacement cycle and moved over warmer waters, regaining Category 3 intensity by midnight on September 5. In the early hours of September 6, Dorian weakened to Category 1 intensity as it picked up speed and turned northeast. Dorian would pick up speed and move northeast along the North Carolina coast September 6, moving east of the Crystal Coast, clipping Cape Lookout and eventually making landfall at Cape Hatteras before making yet another landfall in Nova Scotia on September 8.||The initial impacts from Dorian actually occurred during the morning hours of September 5 when several tornadoes touched down in eastern North Carolina. The most damaging tornado occurred in Emerald Isle in Carteret County. The tornado touched down shortly after 9 AM and damaged numerous businesses and homes, including the Salty Pirate Water Park. This tornado was rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale with estimated winds of 115 mph. As the eye of Dorian moved northeastward and clipped Cape Lookout, peak wind gusts of 110 mph were recorded at the Cedar Island Ferry Terminal, 89 mph at Fort Macon, 85 mph at Beaufort and 82 mph at Cape Lookout. Wind gusts around 100 mph were also recorded on Hatteras Island. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches were recorded across a broad area of Eastern North Carolina. Storm surge flooding occurred in Cedar Island, Hatteras Island, and Ocracoke Island. The most severe storm surge flooding occurred in Ocracoke where several people were trapped in their attics by flooding from the 4-to-7-foot storm surge, requiring rescue by boats. People were airlifted off the island to shelters on the mainland while food and water were brought in to residents on the island. North Carolina Highway 12 along Ocracoke Island suffered significant damage from flooding. More than 190,000 North Carolina homes lost power during the storm.","Hurricane force wind gusts, flash flooding due to rainfall rates over 2 inches per hour, and minor storm surge were felt across western portions of Carteret County during the early morning hours. A peak wind gust of 89 mph was measured at the Fort Macon WxFlow site at 4:21 AM.",37195,35.7,-77.92
