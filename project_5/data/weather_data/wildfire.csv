Fanned by 20 mph winds, it grew to more than 200 acres in two hours and destroyed three residences and three outbuildings. Before the first day was over, 1300 acres had burned. Eventually 6532 acres would be burned, along with numerous infrastructure supporting utilities and highway transportation before it was fully contained three days later. Smoke, flames, and heat from the fire halted ground and air transportation across the San Bernardino Mountains and between the High Desert and the Inland Empire of San Bernardino County for two days. Between 50 to 70 trains and 13,000 trucks move through the Cajon Pass on a daily basis. This blockage affected shipping in and out of Long Beach Harbor, a major West Coast shipping port. In addition to burning 57 power poles, heat from the fire forced the shutting down of all power transmission lines and a natural gas line across the mountains. These outages in turn affected about 500,000 customers in communities far removed from the incident site. Initially 40 homes were evacuated the first day in the Swarthout Canyon area.  A flare up on the second day forced an evacuation of 100 homes in the Mormon Rocks area. Smoke blown over the Victor Valley caused air quality to dip below healthful levels at times.

It burned 59,448 acres before being fully contained on  November 5, 2003. During the first seven days, the fire increased rapidly in size and burned across freeways, railways, and into the communities of Glen Helen, Cajon Canyon, Mt. Baldy Village, Lytle Creek, Rancho Cucamonga, and Fontana. It destroyed 135 houses, 60 outbuildings, 1 commercial property, 1 helicopter, 11 cars, 1 boat, 1 trailer, and several miles of utility and highway infrastructure. It also damaged another 71 houses and 10 outbuildings. Atmospheric conditions preceding the fire were: maximum temperatures near 105 degrees, minimum relative humidity around 5%, and winds from the northeast 10 to 20 mph during the night and morning hours, switching to southwest 5-10 mph during the afternoon hours. After the fire started, the afternoon southwest winds became more dominate, and the fire generally was wind driven. On October 24, the predominate wind direction returned to northeast and gusted 40 to 70 mph with relative humidities ranging from a minimum of 3% to a maximum of 28%.  On October 25, when the northeast winds temporarily relaxed, the fire became plume dominated as the heat column rose into the dry and unstable mid and upper layers. During this time and for about 30 minutes following the collapse of the plume, fire whirls were observed. On October 26, the west flank of the Old Fire and the east flank of the Grand Prix Fire merged in the Cajon Pass, forming a 30 mile long flaming front. The west flank of the Grand Prix Fire that had now burned into Los Angeles County and the Angeles National Forest, was renamed the Padua Fire for administrative purposes. Smoke from these fires forced the closure of air traffic for four hours at Ontario, Los Angeles, Burbank, and Orange County airports. On the 8th day of the fires, the northeast winds finally relaxed. The following day, October 29, the wind flow switched to the southwest, and the air mass moistened rapidly. Through the remaining days of October and into early November, precipitation fell over the fire area, with rainfall averaging from 0.25 to over 1.00 inch, while 3 to 12 inches of snow fell at elevations above 6500 feet. However, the fire though not as active, was not fully contained when the month of October ended.",No entry,6071,CA,San Bernardino County,California,34.83,-116.19

During the month of October, it destroyed 850 houses, 10 commercial buildings, 1460 power poles, 220 electrical transformers, several miles of highway and utility infrastructure. It also damaged another 35 houses. The entire San Bernardino Mountain range was evacuated. An estimated 80,000 people were evacuated during the first day, and this caused a 28 mile long traffic jam on Highway 18. Eventually the foothill communities of Silverwood Lake, South Hesperia, Oak Hills, Summit Valley, Telephone Canyon, and Las Flores were also evacuated. Smoke, ash, and/or flames from the fire severely impacted and/or halted ground, air, and rail transportation into and out of Southwest California several times. Atmospheric conditions preceding it's start and during the first four days were: high temperatures 90 to 100 degrees, relative humidity ranging from 3 percent during the day to 20 percent at night, and predominate north to northeast winds. The condition and loading of the fuels also caused the fire to grow upwind and up slope against 25 to 50 mph winds. On the first day of the fire, it destroyed 400 houses and 10 commercial buildings. By the second day it had merged with the east flank of the Grand Prix Fire. By the third day when the northeast winds were no longer dominate, it burned over the ridge line, through the Cajon Pass, and down the high desert steppe towards Hesperia. On the fourth day, Wednesday Oct. 29th, an increase in southwest flow caused the southeast flank of the fire to grow rapidly towards Big Bear Lake. Wind gusts over 40 mph were measured across the ridges. Moisture increased rapidly over the next several days and light rain fell along the coastal slopes and ridge tops. As the month of October closed, the fire was still active and hooking around the northwest and northeast side of the San Bernardino Mountain range, threatening to burn up the north slope and into the resort communities.",No entry,6071,CA,San Bernardino County,California,34.83,-116.19

During the first 36 hours, the fire grew at a rate of 6000 acres/hour. At one point it had a 45 mile long flaming front and threatened to merge with the Paradise Fire to the north and the Otay Fire to the south. During the month of October, it consumed 275,833 acres and destroyed: 2403 residential, commercial, and industrial buildings; 2725 accessory buildings; 3302 vehicles, travel trailers, boats, and tractors; 500 power poles; and several miles of utility and highway infrastructure. It damaged another 155 residential, commercial, and industrial buildings; 16 accessory buildings; and 11 vehicles, travel trailers, boats, and tractors. Of the acreage consumed, 33,000 were within the city limits of San Diego. Communities affected included: Lake Cuyamaca, Wynola, Pine Hills, Harrison Park, Scripps Ranch, Tierrasanta, San Diego Estates, Poway, Ramona, Santee, Lakeside, Blossom Valley, Pine Valley, Descanso, and Julian. Federal property containing the Miramar Marine Corp Air Station, the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control Radar (TRACON) and the National Weather Service's radar (WSR-88D) and upper air inflation shelter was also consumed. Two U.S.N. troop carriers and QualComm Stadium were used as evacuation shelters. Poor air quality and visibility due to the smoke and ash forced the closures of schools and air and ground transportation. East to northeast winds continued to gust near 40 mph until midday October 29 when the Santa Ana wind event ended.  During the next 24 hours, the winds gusted from the opposite direction between 25 and 40 mph. Moisture increased rapidly and light rain and drizzle were observed over much of the fire area. As the month ended the fire was still active.",No entry,6073,CA,San Diego County,California,33.02,-116.77

Because of the dry conditions, an ember from an unattended fire, a discarded cigarette, a spark from machinery or a rifle, or lightning could easily start a fire.  Due to the high fire danger, the governor of Virginia instituted a statewide outdoor burning ban between October 15th and December 11th.  Even with precautions in place, several wildfires broke out during the month of November.  Statewide, 999 fires burned 10,909 acres during the fall season.  Gusty winds caused a few fires to rapidly spread out of control and consume hundreds of acres.  In Page County, a brush fire which started on Dovel Mountain on the 19th burned around 1000 acres before being brought under control on the 28th.  Gusty winds turned the 15 acre ""Hickory Run"" fire into an 850 acre inferno within 24 hours which resulted in the evacuation of the Shenandoah Gap development.  On the evening of the 19th, one home was burned to the ground in the development and another sustained significant fire damage.  Twenty five other homes in the community were spared by the firefighter's efforts.  A smaller fire burned in the Lucas Hollow area nearby on the 21st.  Rapid response kept the fire from expanding beyond 50 acres and it was contained the same day.  In Albemarle County, a large ""ground based"" fire began along Route 633 northwest of Covesville on the 18th, most likely sparked by a discarded cigarette.  The fire burned up Heard Mountain and led to the closure of Heard Mountain Road.  It burned a total of 1100 acres before being brought under control on the 21st.",A wildfire burned 1000 acres on Dovel Mountain.

The fire was monitored but not actively suppressed as it spread slowly over the next three weeks reaching only 617 acres in size by Friday, August 19. However, lowering relative humidity and increasing wind whipped the fire over the coming few days. The fire had grown to nearly 1,800 acres by Monday, August 22. On that day, warm, windy, and dry conditions enabled the fire to nearly triple in size to over 6,000 acres. This led to the closure of US Highway 89/191/287 between Leeks Marina and Flagg Ranch near the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. Several campgrounds in Grand Teton National Park were also closed because of the fire. Favorable weather for rapid fire-growth continued through Wednesday, August 24, and the fire grew to over 12,000 acres. The fire exhibited slow growth through the end of August as consumed acreage climbed to about 14,000 acres. Less active fire behavior allowed the highway to reopen Tuesday morning, August 30.

This combination resulted in extreme fire behavior and the fire spread six miles to the northeast during the afternoon and evening consuming about 6,000 acres.

Helicopters were used by the State Forest Fire Service to battle the blaze and plow lines had been established behind the houses on Sooy Place Road.

A state of emergency was declared at state and federal levels due to the fires.","The Carr Fire began on the afternoon of July 23, 2018, at the intersection of Highway 299 and Carr Powerhouse Road, near French Gulch in Shasta County. The fire is reported to have been started accidentally by a vehicle towing a trailer that had a tire blow out, causing the steel rim to scrape along the pavement, generating sparks that ignited dry vegetation along the edge of the highway. Local winds generated by the fire are reported to have caused the fire to spread quickly.||At the end of July, the fire was the sixth most destructive fire in California history at 112,888 acres, with 1,378 structures destroyed, 965 of them homes. The fire was not fully contained until August 30, reaching 229,651 acres in size with a total of 1,079 residences, 22 commercial structures, 503 outbuildings destroyed.

While dry Junes are not uncommon (this was Bakersfield���s 72nd dry June, and Fresno���s 50th), the prospect of a dry June coming on the heels of the driest March-May on record for Bakersfield, and the 4th driest for Fresno, was a factor in Governor Schwarzenegger declaring a drought for the state on June 4th. In addition to the agricultural and hydrological impacts of the dry weather, the fire danger due to dried brush and other vegetation was high, and thunderstorms that moved through the state during the latter half of the month triggered numerous wildfires.||Bakersfield ended the 2007-2008 rain season (which runs from July 1st to June 30th) with a season total of only 2.38 inches, or 36.7 % of the normal of 6.49 inches. The past season was the 2nd driest on record, surpassed only by the 1933-34 season which saw only 2.21 inches. Fresno fared much better, due to an unseasonably wet December through February, but the rains ended abruptly in late February and the season ended with 8.40 inches.

While dry Junes are not uncommon (this was Bakersfield���s 72nd dry June, and Fresno���s 50th), the prospect of a dry June coming on the heels of the driest March-May on record for Bakersfield, and the 4th driest for Fresno, was a factor in Governor Schwarzenegger declaring a drought for the state on June 4th. In addition to the agricultural and hydrological impacts of the dry weather, the fire danger due to dried brush and other vegetation was high, and thunderstorms that moved through the state during the latter half of the month triggered numerous wildfires.||Bakersfield ended the 2007-2008 rain season (which runs from July 1st to June 30th) with a season total of only 2.38 inches, or 36.7 % of the normal of 6.49 inches.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs. Reports indicated that the fire began on 9/11/11 at 1200 PDT due to heavy lightning strikes from thunderstorms. ||The Tamarack wildfire occurred just northeast of Yosemite Valley in Mariposa County on 9/13/11 at 1912 PDT.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs.

The source of the fire was non-meteorological, but gusty southerly winds helped to cause rapid fire spread. The fire was most intense the afternoon, evening, and overnight of March 30, before a cold front with widespread showers helped with containment efforts on March 31. By the time the fire was fully contained, more than 11,000 acres of forest had burned. Smoke plumes traveled northward, and a low level inversion led to numerous reports of the smell of smoke in areas north of the fire region. Smoke plumes relating to this fire were reported in METAR observations from multiple large New York City area airports on the morning of the 31st.","Reference the episode narrative for a summary of events.

National Weather Service weather stations along with the Oklahoma mesonet measured sustained wind speeds ranging from 17 to 30 knots (20-35 mph) on November 27th into the 28th, with numerous wind gusts ranging from 39 to 56 knots(45-65 mph). Winds were initially strong from the south to west then shifted to the north and northwest behind a cold front. The winds began to decrease during the afternoon hours of November 28th as the strong surface low continued to lift away from the area. Wind damage was reported in several locations along with numerous power outages. The strong winds also combined with very dry conditions to help with the start and spread of several wildfires. Some fires may have been started by power lines arcing or even coming down in the high winds. The wildfires ranged from a few hundred acres to a few thousand acres some of which for several days. Many fire fighters and resources from the local, state, and federal levels were used to fight these fires. Many structures, hay, pasture, etc. were destroyed by the fires. Some residents were evacuated due to a few of the fires. Several people were injured at various fires.","A wildfire near Velma in Stephens county burned approximately a 15 mile area. The fire began on November 27th and continued to burn into the first part of December. The fire caused the evacuation of some residents and at one point surrounded the town of 664 people. The fire also caused the closure of State Highway 7. Four firefighters suffered smoke inhalation. Several residents also received minor burns. Strong winds and dry conditions combined to cause this fire to spread quickly. About 20 fire departments assisted in fighting the fire. Overall, the fire destroyed 16 homes, including 8 mobile homes, and numerous outbuildings, including two large barns. The exact cause of the fire had not been determined but downed power lines in the strong winds may have started the fire. The property damage for this fire is estimated at one million dollars.In Cotton county, a wildfire 4 miles east and 3.5 miles north of Walters destroyed 6 homes and a few barns. The afternoon fire took 5 hours to bring under control. The property damage is estimated at $650,000.In Garvin county, two wildfires moved across the area. A large fire began 3 miles north of Elmore City on State Highway 74 at 1330 CST. The fire burned approximately 6,000 acres and was reported to be 5 miles wide at times. The fire was eventually stopped southwest of White Bead and 5 miles from Pauls Valley at around 0130 CST on November 28, 2005. A total of 100 firefighters and law enforcement personnel from 14 departments responded to the fast moving fire. Approximately 150 residents were evacuated from the area. This fire destroyed 2 houses and a mobile home along with several outbuildings in the area. The estimated property damage for this fire is $350,000. Another smaller fire was reported 5 miles northeast of Pauls Valley about a half hour after the first fire, 1400 CST. This fire burned about 500 acres and was reported to have 20 foot flames at times. The fire was eventually contained around 2000 CST. Even though this fire was smaller, it did destroy several outbuildings. The fire is thought to have been set by an electric fence charger. However, no official cause has been reported.

These winds persisted through the mid afternoon hours, and resulted in widespread blowing dust and one injury. At least a dozen wind-driven wildfires were sparked over the South Plains. Four of the wildfires were significant, and resulted in the loss of property and three injuries. The winds and fires on the 1st combined to result in four injuries and estimated property losses that exceeded $350,000 .","A wildfire that initiated near Tatum, New Mexico, burned several thousand acres of rangeland and threatened structures as it spread across the Texas/New Mexico state-line into Yoakum County near Bronco.

In response, strong winds spread over the West Texas region during the afternoon hours on May 24. The strong winds lead to several wind-driven grass fires as well as a couple localized high wind gusts. Reduced visibilities were reported across the region with three-quarter mile visibility reported at Lubbock International Airport at 14:53 CST.||The first high wind gust was observed at a KVII-TV Schoolnet site in Hart (Castro County). The site recorded a measured gust of 58 mph at 13:48 CST. A second severe wind gust was observed from the Texas Tech University mesonet site at Reese Center (Lubbock County). The site measured a peak gust of 59 mph at 14:40 CST which was determined to be associated with the passage of a large wind-driven wildfire.||This wildfire at Reese Center destroyed the mesonet site causing $12,000 in damage.  Additionally, as the fire passed through the mesonet site, a maximum temperature of 148 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded at 1.5 meters before the sensor failed. The fire also destroyed the anemometer at a height of 10 meters. The Lubbock County Sheriff's Office closed roads near this wildfire due to low visibility within the smoke along with evacuating 30 to 50 residences.

A second storm developed across western Floyd County. A series of microbursts produced winds estimated as high as 65 mph at times. These winds inflicted sporadic damage to trees, windows, power poles, and caused a few incidents of minor structural damage mainly in central and eastern sections of Lubbock as well as western portions of Lynn County and central Floyd County. Scattered power outages were common. In the wake of this storm, lightning triggered a grass fire near the KCBD-TV news station prompting an evacuation of the building during a live newscast. The fire was estimated to be five acres and caused no known damage or injuries. Additionally, a landspout tornado formed along one of the outflow boundaries in Lubbock County.

A separate fire in Cheney destroyed a garage.  A state of emergency was declared by the state governor in Spokane and Ferry counties.  The strongest winds from this front channeled down the Okanogan Valley, where Oroville received a peak wind gust of 74 MPH, and Omak 59 MPH.  Numerous trees and power poles were blown down by the high winds.  There was a total of 5,000 power outages mostly around Oroville, Tonasket, and Omak.  In Tonasket, a ten inch diameter tree was downed by the winds, causing extensive damage to a carport and RV.  Power poles were also blown down by the winds in Tonasket.  Blowing dust was also common with the front passage with visibilites as low as a half mile in Omak.  Colville and areas just north of Colville also saw strong winds with gusts to 55 mph which resulted in numerous 12 inch diameter trees as well as several power lines being knocked down.  Eight thousand customers lost power in Colville.  Several trees were blown down on highway 20 west of Republic.  In Kettle Falls, wind gusts to 55 mph knocked down several tree branches. Several other large fires resulted which spread quickly by the strong winds.  These include the French Valley Fire, centered seven miles southeast of Omak, which burned 1,420 acres.

These winds resulted in widespread blowing dust across region.  Visibility at Lubbock's Preston Smith International Airport dropped to less than one-quarter mile in the dust storm.  Similar dust storm conditions undoubtedly occurred at many South Plains locales, but went unreported.  Damage brought on by the winds and resultant wildland fires were of much greater concern.||Shortly after 12:00 CST, winds caused power lines to arc in the 5600 block of 45th Street in Lubbock (Lubbock County). An urban-wildland fire quickly sparked and ran through yards and severely damaged six residences.  Three homes, two sheds, two boats, and a vehicle were destroyed.  A dog was killed, but no human casualties were reported.  Lubbock fire fighters additionally fought a fire near the 400 block of East 50th Street around 15:00 CST.

U.S. Highway 62/70 was closed as the west-Matador fire, which started at a road-side park twelve miles west of Matador, rapidly spread eastward toward the town.  An army of first responders invaded Matador to evacuate its residents toward a defensible area at the Motley County High School gymnasium.  One fire fighter was treated for minor burns.  At least two homes were severely damaged or destroyed on the southern extent of the city, and many outbuildings were burned.  The community of Roaring Springs was additionally threatened without incident.||Around 15:45 CST, a wind-driven fire ignited at an airport just east of Post (Garza County).  The fire quickly developed into a massive wildland fire that consumed 9,500 acres before it was contained around 23:00 CST.  The fire destroyed a 20 foot by 30 foot telecommunications building which was valued at approximately $2 million.  A fire engine was partially burned.||Wind-driven wildfires also ignited near Spur and Afton (Dickens County) and near Aspermont (Stonewall County).  These fires collectively accounted for between 5,000 acres and 10,000 acres burned and took a number of outbuildings.  Additional and less significant fire starts were observed on the north rim of Tule Canyon near Lake MacKenzie in Briscoe County, in Bailey County, Childress County, and Hale County.  In all, at least 11 wind-driven grassland wildfires impacted the extreme Southern Panhandle and the South Plains.||The high winds experienced in the Lubbock (Lubbock County) area during the afternoon hours caused extensive roof damage to an apartment complex near 1930 Baylor Street.

The combination of strong winds, low relative humidities and dry fuels allowed the wildfire spread rapidly through the steep, heavily forested terrain.  The flames were reportedly 20 to 50 feet in length.  Towns within the burn area included Salina, Wallstreet and Gold Hill.  The dry conditions coupled with gusty winds ranging from 45 to 64 mph persisted for several more days.  ||Fire managers used as many as 700 firefighters and support personnel from 35 agencies and seven air tankers to battle the wildfire.  A total of 6,181 square acres or approximately 10 square miles were burned.  The Fourmile Canyon Wildfire was the most destructive fire in Colorado history in terms of the damage to personal property.

Fortunately, no structural damage or injuries were reported.||This fire ignited around 1 PM in a rural area of far south central Valley County, a short distance southeast of the intersection of Nebraska Highways 22 and 70. Unfortunately, weather conditions were ripe for rapid fire spread and growth. Although relative humidity (RH) values averaged around 30% (slightly above official critical values), very strong northwest winds whipped the flames through dry grasses, with sustained speeds generally 25-35 MPH and frequent gusts to around 45 MPH. It didn't take long for the fire to jump over the county line into far northern Sherman County. Given that it was tracking toward the north side of Sherman Reservoir, several residences in the area were evacuated as a precaution. Fortunately, the fire was brought under control north of the reservoir by early evening before affecting any structures, thanks to the efforts of 13 rural fire departments and even one fire-fighting aircraft. This fire ended up consuming roughly 6,000 acres of dormant pasture and farm land as it traveled a relatively narrow, northwest-to-southeast path of 6-7 miles. On a side note, while only a small fraction of South Central Nebraska was directly impacted by this fire, a highly-visible and locally-thick smoke plume drifted at least 50-100 miles southeast during the afternoon, briefly reducing visibilities in many places, including the Hastings area.",No entry,31039,NE,Cuming County,Nebraska,41.92,-96.79
