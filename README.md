**Matt Paterson, hello@HireMattPaterson.com**

In collaboration with Matthew Burrell and Eric Laverdiere, Data Science Fellows at General Assembly

This repo contains a dataset pulled from the google cloud platform SQL BigQuery database related to COVID-19.  

We have also gained insights from datasets from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

This project is ongoing and this is the first commit to this repository and does not yet contain additional datasets including but not limited to regional population data, natural disaster data, weather and noaa data, or usgs data.
