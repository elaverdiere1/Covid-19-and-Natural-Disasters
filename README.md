### How risky is your county?
**Using data related to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, earthquakes over the last twenty years, and major weather events of the last thirty years, this project attempts to allow a user to enter a zip code in to a user interface, and see in return a map of the United States that highlights their region and prints out the relative risks associated with each of the above mortal dangers.**


This repo contains a dataset pulled from the google cloud platform SQL BigQuery database related to COVID-19.  

We have also gained insights from datasets from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Before completion there will be other data sources cited as well.

This project is ongoing and this is the second commit to this repository and does not yet contain additional datasets including but not limited to natural disaster data, weather and noaa data, or usgs data.
